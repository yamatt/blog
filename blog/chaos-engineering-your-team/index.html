This recent post <a href=https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/should-your-team-adopt-no-meeting-weeks>&ldquo;Should Your Team Adopt No-Meeting Weeks&rdquo; really resonated with me</a>.</p><p>I read an article while back, but of course I cannot find now, about how you might want to consider applying <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_engineering>Chaos Engineering</a>, not only to your technology, but also your people. A random person gets selected maybe once a week, to take the day off. Simulating a sick-leave like situation.</p><p>I&rsquo;m a huge proponent of the idea that no single person should be critical to your business, and in fact they become a massive risk to your business that is only realised once they leave. It also creates an uncollaborative working environment because you will have a lot of different pressures from different people on one person. This is covered a lot in <a href=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business-ebook/dp/B00AZRBLHO>The Phoenix Project</a>.</p><p>Using the principles behind Chaos Engineering you can build in expectations in to your team that you should be able to survive the loss of a person.</p><p>What I like with the experiment mentioned in the post, taking a random person out of meetings, was that this it is similar to Chaos Engineering your team, but at a smaller scale. In the situation where the person, who is critical to your meeting, gets unceremoniously booted out of said meeting, you have identified a process that doesn&rsquo;t account for the loss of one person.</p><p>The other issue is that if people learn they&rsquo;re not necessary for a meeting they stop coming, which I assume is the intention. However now, you start kicking out important people from the meeting, such as the executive authoriser who was there specifically for that meeting.</p><p>In the post these issues was explained as the experiment failing. I would look at it from the other direction, it&rsquo;s a failing of the processes to have a dependency in a single person.</p><p>As CGP Grey often says, <a href=https://youtu.be/boezS4C_MFc>one is none</a>.</p><p>Now don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;m not saying you need two (or more) executives in the meeting. I&rsquo;m taking the broader picture. Does everyone really need to be in the same room at the same time? In my experience I would say 90% of the time the answer is no.</p><p>Instead the major discussions should happen before the meeting, on your preferred collaboration tool. Any reading material can be distributed before hand and consumed at your leisure. If someone has a vested interest, such as an executive authoriser, they can raise any concerns before anyone steps in the room.</p><p>The meeting becomes a formality to say &ldquo;a decision needs to be made by this date and time&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s more like that cliche moment in weddings in movies where the vicar says &ldquo;Speak now or forever hold your peace&rdquo;. The meeting should be 5 minutes tops.</p><p>The only other time people might want to meet at the same time is if something was being presented, such as a town hall or a sprint review. In those situations you should ensure that those meetings are recorded and published so that others can view and ask questions later if they were interested, but weren&rsquo;t able to attend.</p><p>This leaves everyone free to work on what&rsquo;s important, when it&rsquo;s important. Not spending their entire day in meetings being presented material they could have accessed at any time. Or using time less efficiently because they&rsquo;re winding up to a meeting.</p><p>But, as the original post admits, this may only work in a Google-eque business process utopia.</p></article><div class=pagination><a class=pagination__item href=https://matt.copperwaite.net/blog/common-sense-as-bad-practice/><span class=pagination__label>Previous Post</span>
