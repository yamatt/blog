Each of which took a significant amount of time to resolve, time that could have spent improving the features and capability of our main product.</p><p>Something I identified, as part of this response, was that as engineers, have several names for things that are very closely related, namely, Keys, Secrets and Tokens, there might even be others. I think any seasoned engineer will recognise that they do refer to different things, after all, we have <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/kms/>AWS KMS</a> and <a href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html>AWS Secrets Manager</a>. But an IAM User has <a href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html>both keys and secrets</a> and that keys is a different kind of key to the KMS key.</p><p>Having a common language reduces change fatigue and rework when a problem that everyone who thought they understood a problem discovered that they didn&rsquo;t. This way we can have better confidence in the outcomes of the problem we&rsquo;re discussing.</p><p>I needed a way of describing, without significant friction, a way to refer to values that are used by systems to interoperate (i.e.: not a password), are sensitive, and need careful management.</p><p>I decided that the best word to encompass this was <em>Secret</em>. It seemed like it had more meaning, in a more succinct way than any of the other terms available.</p><p>I proposed this to our business via our usual engineering approvals board and it got accepted.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not to say that the usage of the word Key, or Token is banned, but that Secret emcompassed them all. The word <em>Secret</em> could also mean a key or a token. Something sensitive that needs protecting.</p><p>There are likely differences in each business that may mean that <em>secret</em> isn&rsquo;t the right word for you, but having at least an awareness how these words mean similar, or different things can be helpful.</p></article><div class=pagination><a class=pagination__item href=https://matt.copperwaite.net/blog/social-marketing/><span class=pagination__label>Previous Post</span>
