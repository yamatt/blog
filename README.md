# Matt Copperwaite Blog

This is a site I built using Hugo to generate me a static blog in GitHub.

## Note

* There are likely unpublished articles in this repository. These are being continuously worked and should not be considered my views.

* All articles are not necessarily representative of the views of my employer.
