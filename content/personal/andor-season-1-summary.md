I was asked to tl;dr Andor Season 1 as I was reaching it.

<!--more-->

The gist of it is that a child called Andor is kidnapped from his home planet by scrap dealers.

Immediately ends up in prison for like 5 years.

When he leaves he immediately steals a MacGuffin from the Empire.

He then decides his next step is to go looking for his sister in a brothel for some reason.

Ends up in a fight with some security guards who he overpowers and shoots.

He then tries to sell the MacGuffin he stole but the guy who wants it decides he is the perfect person to fly ships despite never having demonstrated that ability before.

Andor is being pursued by more security guards, and is forced join a group of rebels who are going to rob a bank.

Everyone male on the bank heist dies, but they do get the money.

Because they robbed a bank the Empire cracks down on security. So Andor thinks he will retire but gets sent to prison instead.

In prison he helps gollum build the Death Star and discovers gollum can't swim.

There's also a bit where Ginny Weasley is annoyed about the security guys being shot so falls in love with an FBI agent.
