I don't think I've seen anything like it.

[Doritos have a Minecraft promotion on](https://web.archive.org/web/20250403185435/https://www.joy-pepsico.eu/en-gb/find-a-doritos-square).

[McDonald's have a Minecraft promotion on](https://web.archive.org/web/20250403211539/https://www.mcdonalds.com/gb/en-gb/meal/big-mac-minecraft-movie-meal-medium.html).

[Even Lush have a Minecraft promotion on](https://web.archive.org/web/20250207181046/https://www.lush.com/uk/en/c/minecraft-x-lush).

I'm certain there are others I haven't spotted.

And the movie isn't out yet. Tomorrow.

It could be terrible.

I haven't seen anything this heavily promoted in many many years.
