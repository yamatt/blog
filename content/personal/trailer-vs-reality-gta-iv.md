So the second GTA IV trailer is out and is heading to be one of the most watched videos on YouTube in the shortest amount of time.

And it looks great.

<!--more-->

But I would also temper that with some caution.

The trailer makes the game look perfect, but that's exactly its job.

At the end of the trailer it says it was captured on a PS5. Presumably a PS5 Pro with full ray tracing, because why would you not?

So given the game is _currently_ slated to be out in over a years time, there's a reasonable assumption that the tech will have moved on and perhaps look even better. Let's not forget the PC release will happen another year after that, at the earliest.

But what if you don't have a PS5 Pro? Presumably GTA IV is designed to run on current generation consoles.

Will it look as good when it actually gets to release.

One of the things that bugs me is that with GTA V there were quite some differences between the trailer and the game that came out.

Perhaps Rockstar will address these, or perhaps, as is suspected with GTA V, they really had to squeeze the performance out of end of life consoles and [made cuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNB8P3EEX4).

The main difference is removing the density of life from the game. The number of people, the amount of vegetation.

I would argue this removed a lot of the immersion.

One thing I would so though is that GTA IV doesn't look like it adds much in terms of graphics to the game. Trailers for Cyberpunk 2077 (2020) look comparable to GTA IV.

But before you head to the comments, where the difference lies is the density and variety in game.

So I'm interested to see if this lasts to the finished product.
