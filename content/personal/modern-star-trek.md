There's been a lot of talk online in the last few weeks about modern trek and what it means.

Second Wind, Trek Culture, Angela Collier, Critical Drinker.

This all seems sparked by the recent release of Star Trek Academy, and the slightly less recent release of Section 31.

Now I am a (nearly) life long fan of Star Trek. I remember very clearly watching The Next Generation in the mid-90s on BBC2 at 6.45 (after two episodes of The Simpsons) and really just loving it.

For me, 90s Trek is Star Trek.

But as a (nearly) life long fan of Star Trek, I also recognise that Star Trek is also terrible.

There are some great episodes, but there are a lot of bad and a lot more _meh_.

What I've been struggling with is, is modern Trek bad, or is it that it does not live up to my rose tinted bloom of 90s Trek.

I find it really hard to separate those two.
