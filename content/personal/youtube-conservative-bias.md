One thing I've noticed about YouTube comments is how positive they are.

YouTube comments have a reputation of being a lawless area. But, at least in my experience, over the last few years finding a negative comment is pretty difficult, to the inclusion of pretty obvious bot accounts.

Today there is a pretty interesting comparison taking place, videos from both [Donald Trump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YY5BPigFKgs) and [Justin Trudeau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB7-dbYuCc) are trending on YouTube.

But the comments are the reverse of my expectations, fawning comments at the top of Trump's post, and at the top of Trudeau, neutral to negative comments.

It seems very rare to see negative comments on YouTube videos that this was quite stark to me.

There are differences between the videos. Trumps is clearly a movie trailer for the next 4 years. The only thing missing is Redd Pepper narrating over the thing.

Whereas Trudeau is setting out a plan, a bit of data, and admitting some mistakes.

Personally I prefer Trudeau's, it's honest, and shows he knows how to politic. I would love it if more politicians spoke just as openly and frankly.

But that does not seem to be where the tide is moving, at least as far as YouTube comments go.
