title: Daily Dose of Reddit
draft: true
---

I always end up getting in to Reddit around Christmas, because there's a lot of down time.

And I always regret it. The #enshittification the #infinitescroll and the sore neck I get for killing hours on there.

I really like Daily Dose of Internet on YouTube, every few days a sub 10 minute video of the best social media videos. No "reactions", no filler.

I was thinking, well maybe I could do that for Reddit. Scrape the best 20 or so, every day posts and put it in an RSS feed.

So I built DDOR.

One limitation, the enshittification of Reddit means there is no longer an open API.


So I switched to Lemmy, and its working pretty well.


What I came to realise though, is that my choosing algorithm is flawed.

Last 24 hours means that posts closer the time I take my snapshot will have a lower score, and therefore won't be as prominent.

So then I could take quite a few approaches that look at trajectory, or 'top' and 'hot' buckets. Y Combinators Hacker News has it's own ranking algorithm published, so does Twitter/X.

But then I realised the rabbit hole I'm going down is the exact same thing all these social media companies are trying to do to keep you on the site for longer, and they have got in trouble for.

So because of a silly little side project I have more of an understanding of what social media companies are doing, and more empathy for what they were trying to do.

And I hope you do too.
