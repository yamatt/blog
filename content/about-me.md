Hi, I'm Matt Copperwaite. I was formally employed as a Civil Servant for the United Kingdom Government for more than 10 years. I am current working in Cyber Security for the Financial Times.

I started off as a Software Engineer, but got heavily involved in IT infrastructure projects and am now specialising in applying IT security to projects using Agile and DevOps techniques.
