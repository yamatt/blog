Hi, I'm Matt Copperwaite. I was formally employed as a Civil Servant for the United Kingdom Government for more than 10 years. I am currently working on Product Security for Komainu, a crypto currency asset management company.

I started off as a Software Engineer, but got heavily involved in IT infrastructure projects and am now specialising in applying IT security to projects using Agile and DevOps techniques.

The content of this blog does not necessarily represent the views of my employer.
