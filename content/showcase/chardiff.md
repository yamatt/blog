CharDiff is an easy-to-use tool to compare 2 strings and highlight the characters in them that are different.

This came about for a couple reasons.

For one I had some very long strings I was working with at the time and I was having a lot of difficulty finding where they differed. I really struggled to find any tools that would allow me to find the difference between strings at a character level.

The other reason was I was looking for a very quick project in Python3 that I could use to do things properly. By which I mean, have tested code, have it running in a CI/CD pipeline (I wanted to play with the GitHub Actions beta I'd got myself on to) and have it publish to PyPI.

I even already have some [nice feedback from some users](https://github.com/yamatt/python3-chardiff/issues/2).

I have seen subsequent posts around the web of tools like this, and there are [definitely better ones out there](https://github.com/johannhof/difference.rs).

But it wasn't to be the best but to expand my knowledge. I now have a template for future projects.
