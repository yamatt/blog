If your organisation employs a lot of good software engineers there is a high probability that they will build tooling that is designed to be used by other teams. The idea is that others don't have to make the same mistakes that they did and can start running from day 1.

The trouble is, in large organisations, discoverability is really difficult. There is often a lot of noise and minimal signal. Either there are 100s of projects in your version control and no decent way of pin-pointing what you need. Or someone new may have no idea who is the person who knows exactly the thing they need.

I recall reading, or perhaps hearing, about Town Halls before. I believe it's a concept from the Spotify model but I it's hard to [find much concrete written about it](https://blog.crisp.se/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/SpotifyScaling.pdf). The idea is that multiple engineering teams come together on a regular basis to share what they are up to.

I ran ours once a month for all teams working on the cloud-native projects. Each team got 10 minutes to show what they were up to. We didn't have to do all teams. It's more about identifying those who have similar goals and therefore those with over-lap should start to engage following the session.

This also solves the problems that a lot of Enterprise Design Authority teams attempt (and usually fail) to solve, which is identifying commonality across projects to minimize wastage and cost. A Town Hall allows autonomous teams to identify effort, and therefore cost, saving opportunities and exploit them for themselves.
