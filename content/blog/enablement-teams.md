There was a joke in my teams for a long time about security parts of the business, coming to us and saying "Security is an enabler". The joke centred this being a platitude with very little effect, or mapping to reality.

I subsequently learnt the language of how Enterprise Security, along with teams like Design Authority and Change Management, are gate-keepers who don't own any risk, and therefore have the habit of impacting your delivery without any repercussions as to your failed delivery.

I've been toying with the idea about how to improve these practices. There is always work that needs to be done, but shouting from afar doesn't help either. These teams need to be proactive.

I'm fortunate that I have been able to influence the team I am working in now to transition from something that may easily have become another gate-keeper in to a pro-active team that works with delivery teams to meet the goals and requirements defined by my department.

This means the developers in my team align themselves to a delivery team for a while, or swarm on a particular project.

However I'm not aware of a model like this. There are of course things that are useful to do, such as keeping my team in contact, motivated, and not bogged down by delivery team work. It's definitely not Agile or Scrum. You have to many people working in different ways. I don't think what we are doing has a name.
