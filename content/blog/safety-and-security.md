It is dark. You hear a beep.

It is dark. You hear a beep.

You check the time. It's almost 2.30am.

Another beep.

What is that?

Is it from outside?

You open a window and wait.

You hear a beep.

It's not outside. That must mean it's inside. That must mean it's your problem.

Shit.

There are lots of things it _could_ be. They're all over the house.

Bleary eyed you stalk around the house. Stopping occasionally to see if you can hear the direction of the beep.

Going in to one room, doubling back on yourself.

A beep above your head. A smoke alarm. Of course it is. 

Your child is asleep in the next room. He doesn't sleep well. You have to fix this quickly and quietly.

What does the beeping mean? The house is not on fire. You happened to have checked that already.

The beeping could mean anything. You don't know the cause. Your mind races. The smoke alarm is mains powered. The smoke alarm could have lost power. Did you do anything recently that might have caused the smoke alarm to have lost power? Could the battery have lost power? _Should_ the battery have lost power if it's been running off mains? How would the smoke alarm know the battery is dying if it mains powered, it isn't using it.

You check online for anything else it could be. It's 3 am. You want to sleep. Not diagnose a beeping smoke alarm that will wake up your family.

There are loads of websites giving you multiple options depending on the type of smoke alarm you have and the kind of beep it's making. But nothing certain. I don't know the make and model of my smoke alarm. They came with the house.

You could turn the whole thing off and worry about it in the morning. Would that make things worse? Would the smoke alarm keep working off their batteries and drain them faster? Would it set all the smoke alarms off as a failsafe?

Apparently it's common for batteries to start failing during the night when the tempurature drops, causing the battery to be less effective.

Your best bet is to replace the battery. [Many people don't know](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0c2g9kr) that a beeping smoke alarm means the battery needs replacing.

Is there a spare? Yes. Fortunately.

It's also fortunate this is not one that needs a massive ladder to reach.

Now how do you replace the battery? How do you open the smoke alarm.

There is some obscure instruction on the side about opening the side. Does it open upwards? Or downwards? Either way it looks like you need a screwdriver to open it. Fortunately you have one of those too. Why do you need to find a screwdriver at 3.30am?

Cannot work out how to get the old battery out. My arms are tired from holding them above my head for so long.

Now you lose it.

You pull on the case. Maybe there is a way in. After easing it a bit, it comes away.

No access to the battery.

Fuck.

At least now you can see how you _would_ get to the draw that holds the battery.

The smoke alarm is slightly closer to the wall and the screwdriver almost doesn't fit.

After a bit of prying the draw comes out and the battery drops out of the draw.

Replace the battery. Put the draw back in.

No beeping?

Go back to bed.

The adrenhilin is surging.

You're waiting for the next beep.

You stay awake until your son wakes at 7am.

## Some time later

My electrician advises a day or so later there are very high voltages in there due to the electronics used to check for smoke. We need to replace the unit.

Given we don't know the age or provienence of any of the smoke alarms and that we have a small family we decide to replace all of them.

The electrician recommends the most popular brand. It's the exact same ones you already have.

At least you know how to replace the battery now.

## Coda

When talking about security it's often useful to make analogies to safety features. Likely because safety is tangible and people like talking about safety. But they're often not directly comparable.

Many people try and cheat smoke alarms by covering them or taking the battery out if they go off too often such as with cooking, or if you want to smoke indoors.

My carbon monoxide detector won't let you close the battery door if you take the battery out. This makes it obvious that the battery has been removed.

It used to be that the regulations in the UK when adding a loft extension, was to ensure all doors are replaced with firedoors that self close.

This lead to people propping the doors open. So the regulations were changed to install smoke alarms that are linked, on all floors.

This is incredibly sensible and pragmatic advice that responds to people's usage of safety equipment.

Safety equipment is often tied to a particular way of working that is complex and expensive to change.

In this scenario though safety equipment also has the same failings as a lot of security products do. Poor guidance. Poor user experience, especially when things go really wrong. Poor quality alerts.

If you want to build good, reliable and accurate equipment you need to think about their failure states and how your users will over-come them.

Because right now I don't want smoke alarms in my house. I want a quiet night sleep.

I wish this story was not based on real events.
