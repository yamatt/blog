Sometimes you just want to experiment, but you get down the road and you realise you're working with lots of people on complex things and maybe now you do need GitFlow and friendly commit messages.

But if you used it at the start you would hamper your progress.

Congratulations you've matured from genesis, which involves a lot of rapid innovation, to a fully fledged mature product.
