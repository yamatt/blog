I had a great time at [AWS Summit London 2023](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/matthew-copperwaite-44319b26_aws-summit-london-today-activity-7072147724900388864-xvfk?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) saw loads of old friends and met new people.

You may well ask what my favourite thing was, and actually it was the talk _How to implement AWS cost optimization strategy_ that works talk by Steph Gooch from AWS and David Andrews from Just Eat.

Why?

Because I see that FinOps and Cyber Security (and data governance) share a lot of the same goals. That being trying to convince developers to do things that they don't have much interest in.

I'm being flippant.

What I enjoyed most about the talk is that the language used is not tainted by years of treating humans as the problem rather than the solution.

Securing IT systems has been around a long time and has it's roots in the military and academia which aren't neceserily reflective of how a business operates. I believe this hinders the adoption of more modern human factors thinking about how users are impacted by security controls.

FinOps does not have any of this baggage being at most [17 years old](https://web.archive.org/web/20121005123855/http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/). So it's refreshing to see how a relatively clean slate can work and inspire developers to care about the thing that you care about.
