As a society we have a tendency to tell people to stop doing something. It's more instinctive to say "Stop doing that!" rather than "Could you do this instead?", possibly because it's easier to know what not to do, than to be creative about what could be done.

The issue that I see though is that when we are presented with multiple options, negative signposting only removes one option. This still provides you many alternatives and provides you little information on finding the right solution. This makes for a poor customer experience as those who do not know better don't know what else to do, and those that have other options are not provided any information when looking for a better solution.

I encountered a real-world example of this in the office recently. There are paper-towels in the office kitchen for drying cutlery, crockery and our hands. We are also provided with a choice of bins to discard our waste items. There is a recycling bin, a food waste bin, and a general bin. Being environmentally conscious, I, and seemingly many others, were discarding our paper-towels in the recycling bin. This is apparently incorrect.

The solution the people who manage the office came up with was to provide a note to each kitchen in the building.

Do you see the problem?

Where _should_ the paper-towels go? Food waste? It does say 'Food only'. Isn't paper made from food-like material though? I'd rather it wasn't General waste? I'd like to avoid it if at all possible. It isn't clear.

## The security angle

What I'm trying to illustrate here is that using ["common sense" is not the answer]({{< ref "./common-sense-as-bad-practice.md" >}}) and neither is blaming your customers, we all own the problem.

If you want to create a difference to a problem you are experiencing you need to analyse the problem and come up with solutions that work in most if not all cases, because our first instincts are often bad.

Worried about weak passwords? Let's enforce more complex ones. Worried about phishing? Lets phish our users and blame them for clicking on the links.

Or we could think about the problem and provide tools our customers want, beyond 'Best Practice' and 'Guidance docs' and in to services that allows them to make good, informed, decisions.

If something has gone wrong, don't mark the action as wrong and control for it, identify what needs to be done to make it go right.
