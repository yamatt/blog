Whenever possible, one of the rules I follow when writing guidance is to create positive messaging. As a society we have a tendency to tell people to stop doing something, rather than telling them how to do the right thing. It's more instinctive to say "Stop doing that!" rather than "Could you do this instead?", possibly because it's easier to know what not to do, than to be creative about what could be done instead.

The other issue is that when we are presented with multiple options, negative signposting removes one option, rather than providing guidance on finding the right solution. This is also more painful when you are genuinely looking for the right solution.

I encountered a real-world example of this in the office. There are paper-towels in the office kitchen for drying cutlery, crockery and ourselves. We are also provided with a choice of bins to discard our waste items. There is a recycling bin, a food waste bin, and a general bin. Being environmentally conscious, I, and turns out others, were incorrectly discarding our paper-towels in the recycling bin. Now there's a separate question about why this is, which firstly, is interesting, but secondly, way outside the purpose of this blog.

The solution they came up with was to affix a note to each kitchen in the building.

Do you see the problem?

Where _should_ the paper-towels go? Food waste? Could be. General waste? I'd like to avoid it if at all possible. It isn't clear.

## Another Example

I recently encountered a similar example on the platforms at my local train station. They have these yellow boxes that contain salt and grit used to de-ice the ground. They are about 50cm tall and their top surface is flat giving them an affordance of a seat. They are however not designed to be sat upon and the weight causes them to break, crack and drop grit, which can in itself be a hazard as the material creates a slippery surface.

The solution the train company had chosen to over-come this? A sign on top of these boxes saying they should not be sat on.

Now imagine you're coming home late at night, drunk, tired, and you've just missed the train. The next one is half an hour away. The platform is busy with other revellers. Are you going to read, understand, or care about a sign on the box?

How do we improve this situation? Well the negative signposting didn't work. Maybe we can go further. The affordance of the box is to resemble a seat. In fact in researching this post if you look up large grit boxes (200L or more) they tend to have tough curved lids that creates an uncomfortable seating surface.

But another way of looking at it is that there is clearly a demand for more seating. Perhaps instead you could make the grit boxes dual use, by making them strong enough to be seating, and once you've reached that point perhaps it would be a better idea to turn the existing seating in to something that can also store grit.

Now there is no doubt that there are other considerations in an environment such as a train station. Things like securing access to storage in case of terrorism, but this is all things that can be worked through with the right considerations. Artefacts like the one described here are the product of single focus thinking. And that is what produces a poor experience for your customers, but also doesn't resolve the underlying problems. 

## How do we improve this?

The quickest answer is a near identical sticker next to whichever is to the correct opening saying "Paper-towels", or perhaps "Paper-towels here please", or even better "Paper towels yum-yum". But that's not the end of the story.

The other issue is that the messaging doesn't scale. Today it's paper-towels, next week people are incorrectly disposing their used pizza boxes. Where should those go?

Most boroughs in London, where my office is, often send leaflets and [put guidance on their websites about what you can recycle](https://www.westminster.gov.uk/check-before-you-chuck#paragraph-id-3463). Learning from their approach perhaps more information could be provided either directly to staff, either on internal services, or in the kitchens themselves. A nice infographic that can be absorbed at a glance.

But let us not stop there. What if a new technology comes along and messes with people's expectations? Perhaps a new kind of eco-packaging, such as cellulose plastics, that can go in to food waste. Now that could mean people could be wasting materials that should be recycled.

Now we're getting to the bottom of the underlying issues.

One option I can see is to educate people in the kitchens not what can go in to the bins, but in to the disposal processes. Enabling them to make informed decisions about where items should be disposed. There will also likely be edge-cases and for those situations we can provide a service that helps people identify where those items should go. The trade-off is that this is context dependent, and potentially expensive.

Another option is that there should be a single bin and the sorting takes place in a different place where the proper assessment of the materials can take place, although I'm sure there are issues with the changing of materials by them spending some time in contact with each other. Again, no doubt expensive.

Another option is to use [affordance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance) that encourages the separation of different kinds of items, such as [Amberol bins that have shaped openings that encourage in particular bottle and paper recycling](https://amberol.co.uk/bins/outdoor-recycling-bins/olympic-dual-bin). This allows people to make minimal effort decisions about where their product should go because they will identify the lowest effort bin to use.

## The security angle

You now might be saying "You've lost me. You've written a lot about bins. What on earth does this have to do with security?"

Well, a lot.

What I'm trying to illustrate here is that using ["common sense" is not the answer]({{< ref "./common-sense-as-bad-practice.md" >}}). If you want to create a difference to a problem you are experiencing you need to analyse the problem and come up with solutions that work in all cases, because our first instincts are often bad.

Worried about weak passwords? Let's enforce more complex ones. Worried about phishing? Lets phish our users and blame them for clicking on the links.

Or we could think about the problem and provide helpful guidance and frameworks that allows them to make good decisions.
