I've been thinking about a series of posts lately on the "why" of Agile. Often those of us who are taught Agile practices are often taught them as activities to follow, parroting the practice, without being given the context of what gives that practice its value.

However adapting the practices to suit your organisations needs and culture is, for me, one of the most important parts of any agile practice and sets it apart from most frameworks that business traditionally use. It is quite possible, reasonable and expected, to adapt your practices using iterative techniques. However sometimes what to change in your practice is non-obvious, or worse, a chosen adaptation has a unintended negative effect.

By understanding the "why" of Agile you should find insights in to the purpose of the practices.

I believe one of the best tools you can use for this the Risk Ownership lens.

Risks are a reasonably broadly understood and certainly even better documented tool for describing problems that will impact an activity. This is already used in Agile in the form of blockers. Things that will lead your project to fail if left unchecked.

Ownership on the other-hand is less well explored, but readily explained. Every task, action, process, observation and recommendation has an owner. Typically this is the originator of the work. Whether they know it or not they are the owner.

Combining the two, Risk Owners are someone, and ideally it is one person, who has ultimate responsibility. They are the ones who get shouted at if something that should have happened, doesn't. Or something that did happen that wasn't supposed to.

And this is why it makes it a great medium for understanding the why of Agile practices. If you change something what does that say about the risk ownership.
