I mean I know I've argued with you about this before. I see it from a different perspective. I don't subscribe to this reactive IT philosophy.

People build shadow IT because core IT is unwilling or unable to deliver what they need. Either in reality or in people's minds.

If you provide the business the tools they need, when they need it, the business knows to work with you and create a partnership, and shadow IT shouldn't need to even exist.

I know you know how much I complained about core IT in the NCA and I know you've seen some of that.

The bit of shadow IT I ran in NCCU ran rings around them I believe not because it was a smaller team - everything was designed for scaling to greater capacity than even the NCA - but because we were known for giving people what they wanted when they wanted it.

That means not turning features off because no one had asked for them. We did that because we knew that the support over-head and for turning it on wasn't worth the benefit of turning it off. As well as preventing the business from doing something they had no reason to expect not to work.

We as IT people are taught not to make assumptions, but we shouldn't punish people for not holding up to that standard.

Sadly so many IT departments have a philosophy of turning stuff off because "no one asked for it". Even though they never asked the question of the business.

You do that 1000 times or more and suddenly you have a load of work to do if, and occasionally when, the business asks for it.

And I reckon 90% of the time the business don't ask. Either because they don't know what they need, they don't know it exists, or they don't feel empowered.

Then as IT people we feel superior that users aren't asking us intelligent questions.

That's not healthy.
