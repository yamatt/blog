I've been listening to the [BBC's How They Made Us Doubt Everything](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000l7q1) which exposes how the manufacturing of doubt was used to protect first the tobacco industry and their link to lung cancer, and eventually the oil industry and their link to climate change.

It's all well worth listening to the whole show if you can get access to it, but one of the episodes that stood out to me was about [climate change communication](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000lgk6) and the section with [Susan Hassol](https://twitter.com/ClimateComms) describing the confusing and conflicting words that scientists use. There is a similar assessment of the poor usage of language used in climate science in [Susan's TEDx talk](https://youtu.be/V-tEmE85QDE).

How this ties in to IT security is that I think the community has a similar communication problem. I don't see evidence that there are adversarial actors involved, intent on casting doubt on the effectiveness of encryption. We can assume it exists but let's we should be thinking about these problems before Security communication has an even larger problem.

MFA, Authentication, Authorisation, backups, privacy. I know what this means to me. I have a hunch about what these might mean to the readers of this post. But what do these mean to those outside the industry, my parents, or my neighbours?

I know when I met my neighbours for the first time I inadvertently got in to a conversation about coding and hacking and had to clarify their meaning. As explained by Hassol, having these communication barriers doesn't help make people and their data safer.

Hassol has a published translation of [commonly confused terms](https://twitter.com/ClimateComms/status/998325439482515456/photo/1), and Gender Decoder, used to check for gender biases in job adverts is also [based on published evidence](https://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/about). Where is that analysis for security terms?

NCSC does put a lot of effort in to this, and has even [re-emphasised their tend pragmatic advice](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/the-logic-behind-three-random-words) when [questioned](https://paul.reviews/passwords-why-using-3-random-words-is-a-really-bad-idea/) on their three random words policy. But I often think, who will have a TV show on how to secure your e-mail? Who will educate the public in looking for better privacy serving products? Who will go on news when a major company gets hit by ransomware or has a data leak?

Who is, or will be, the [David Attenborough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Attenborough) or [Hannah Fry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Fry) of Cyber Security?
