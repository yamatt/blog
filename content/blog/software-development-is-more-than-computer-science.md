I often come across articles in tech news about how the technology industry need more people to study computer science, or that computer science degrees are a good pathway to becoming a software engineer. I would like to refute that assumption.

I'm not denying that having one or many people with an understanding of computer science can be a valuable part of any software delivery team, and in fact my assumption would be that a very mature delivery team would need significant computer science expertise because the major problems will have been solved and are focused on optimisation. However having a mature delivery team is very rare.

Computer science is part of the puzzle, and I'm sure for many a fairly inaccessible part of computing. Personally I prefer the tangible aspects, such as networking (although that is mostly all virtual these days).

This post is to assure, and re-assure, those without an understanding of computer science, and recruiters that computer science doesn't equal a good software engineering team, and vice-versa. I myself do not have a computer science degree, and neither do a lot of my good friends and colleagues in the industry, and they, we, are all extremely capable and valuable people.

There are many useful things computer science can teach you. In fact there are several software design patterns I taught myself and use in everything I write these days. However there are many very important things you will always have to teach yourself. A non-exhaustive list being, getting good user feedback, running a good post-mortem, being a good mentor, identifying your own assumptions. These things can only be taught by experience, and that for me is always better than a certificate.

Getting a team of computer scientists to work on your phone app idea is like getting a team of rocket scientists to build you a bottle rocket. Sure they'll be able to do it, but there is more to building a bottle rocket than having a bunch of experts do it for you.
