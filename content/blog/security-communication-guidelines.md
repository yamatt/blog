Given past articles I've been thinking about the kinds of advice I give to people when writing about security.

I've already explored the question of the audience, and I don't think I'm breaking new ground here. I'm often critical of ITIL, coming from someone with a qualification in it, but their bit on communication is really good at thinking about your audience.

But I'm going to combine that with thinking from Social Marketing.

## Pragmatic

### Realistic

The advice has to be something that the audience is able to do. If your advice says to turn your phone off for the next 2 weeks, people are not going to follow it.

### Achievable

It needs to be something that your audience is able to do. If it has a set of very complex instructions, is it likely they are going to follow it.

## Universal

It has to be instructions that work for everyone in your audience. There's no point providing instructions if they only work for a small set of people. This includes accessability.
