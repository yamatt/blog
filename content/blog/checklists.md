I had originally starting writing an article called "Embrace the chaos". In it I was bemoaning strong controls that enforce a way of working that is inherently going to break once something changes. Encouraging people to be more dynamic. However in researching the subject my view softened a little on it and I no-longer am certain about it's premise.

Those changes in my view stem from a couple of areas:

* [On The Metal podcast featuring Star Simpson](https://oxide.computer/podcasts/star-simpson) in this episode who talked about the virtues of checklists in autonomous flight
* Similarly [preflight checklists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preflight_checklist).
* A recent [Cautionary Tales podcast episode](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5tZWdhcGhvbmUuZm0vY2F1dGlvbmFyeXRhbGVz/episode/ZmIzNzIyYjYtYTE0Ni0xMWVjLTgyMTUtYzc1MGU2NjVjOGM4?sa=X&ved=0CAUQkfYCahcKEwiIy8LUyZP3AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAQ) about architects using checklists
* A conversation with a colleague about Scuba Diving and [Dive Planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dive_planning) and the checks that they do.

I also realised how checklists are implemented in DevOps. Or as most people practising DevOps would call them, a test suite.

Obviously the situations above have different levels of risk. Flying vehicles, architecture, and scuba diving have a higher likelihood of death than software engineering, in general. And I hope in the situations where it doesn't you are using a technique that is less about embracing failure.

There are definitely things to take-away from both sides though. Those checklists for flight vehicles aren't designed one day by thinking about the problem hard. They are built from the study of cases of failure.
