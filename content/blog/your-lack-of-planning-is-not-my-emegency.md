Recently a colleague shared a rule he uses when dealing with urgent requests:

> Your lack of planning is not my emergency

My gut instinct was to disagree with it, but I couldn't articulate it properly at the time. Now I see how it's a negative approach, which always makes me think there has to be a better way and I wanted to explain my reasoning.

The history of it comes from working in IT where often things need to be changed rapidly but the task has a dependency on another team who does not own that change. You're that third party team who now have a bunch of pressure exerted on them because another team encountered something that they hadn't planned for.

Other than the toxic nature of these events meaning additional pressure to your carefully planned work, you could also assume it meant that if you helped out, the team who owned the event hasn't learnt anything and will know to go to you every time in future to get stuff fixed.  A single urgent request in isolation is fine, but several are crippling to a team.

However if a task lands on your desk and you use this rule you are making assumptions when dismissing it outright.

## Lack of Planning

How often in IT are rapid changes caused by a lack of planning? I'm betting in most cases the source of the tasks are incidents, or software patches. If you dismiss the request for assistance, you will be seen as unwilling to help out in an incident, and as someone who is unwilling to participate in urgent changes.

I would expect this also means you reduce your chances of being consulted on future changes, or those who are making changes don't know to inform you of them because you are not considered on the normal path to release.

## Emergency Exit

The other assumption to check is, how much of an emergency is it? I don't know how many project managers I've spoken to who said "Can you do this by tomorrow?" and when you go back to the engineering team they're happy with it being next May, or just whenever. You may have decided not to participate based on faulty data.

I always like to check the deadlines. They rarely hold true. Usually there are multiple streams racing to the date, and it's likely someone is going to call out that they won't meet it. Then everyone is relieved because they were working so hard to get there.

## Happy to Help

You should always be willing to improve the operational effectiveness of your business. To do that you have to participate. Perhaps a team will repeatedly come to you to help solve their problems, but where are their problems stemming from? Are they performing an incident post-mortem, or learning any lessons? Is there something you can do with them to prevent their issues re-arising?

If you haven't planned additional capacity in to your work, then have you really planned your own work properly?
