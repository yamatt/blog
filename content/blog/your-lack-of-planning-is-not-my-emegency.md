Recently a colleague shared a rule he uses when dealing with urgent requests:

> Your lack of planning is not my emergency

My gut instinct was to disagree with it, but I couldn't articulate it properly at the time. Now I see how it's a negative approach, which always makes me think there has to be a better way and I wanted to explain my reasoning.

The history of it comes from working in IT where often capabilities need to be updated in a hurry, but the task has a dependency on another team who does not own that change. You're that third party team who now have a bunch of pressure exerted on them because another team encountered something that they hadn't planned for.

Other than the toxic nature of these events meaning extra pressure to your planned work, you could also assume it meant that if you helped out, the team who owned the event hasn't learnt anything and will know to go direct to you in future to get something fixed.  A single urgent request in isolation a team should have capacity for, but happening regularly can be crippling to a team.

If a task lands on your desk and you use this rule, to dismissing it outright you will be making assumptions.

## Lack of Planning

How often in IT are rapid changes caused by a lack of planning? I'm betting in most cases the source of the tasks are incidents, or software patches. If you dismiss the request, you will be seen as unwilling to help out at a time of need, and as someone who may be unwilling to participate in similar future requests.

I would expect this also means you reduce your chances of being consulted in future, or those who are making changes don't know to inform you of them because you are not considered on the normal path to release.

## Emergency Exit

The other assumption to check is, how much of an emergency is it? Most of the project managers I've worked with would often say "Can you do this by tomorrow?" and when you trace back to the engineering team they're happy with it being the next day, or May, or whenever. You may have decided not to participate based on faulty data.

Often the delivery date has been made up based on guess-work and have no meaning. I always like to check the deadlines. They rarely hold true.

## Happy to Help

You should always be willing to improve the operational effectiveness of your business. To do that you have to participate. Perhaps a team regularly comes to you to help solve their problems, but where are their problems stemming from? Are they performing an incident post-mortem? Or learning any lessons? Is there something you can do with them to prevent their issues re-arising? Perhaps this is the true problem.

Finally, if you haven't planned extra capacity in to your work, then have you actually planned your own work properly?
