I read a blog post recently from the UK Civil Service on how to do good recruitment. It's certainly important that recruitment processes should be transparent and that is appreciated, however I disagreed with the premise that it was a "good" recruitment process.

There are many things wrong with the recruitment process in the Civil Service, but it isn't exclusively isolated to government. But this transparency is an excellent foil for identifying where any recruitment process can be better.

Recruiting the right person for your business certainly can be fraught and frustrating. You could end up with 1000s of candidates or you could end up with 0. It's difficult to plan your workload around that, and presumably you are recruiting because you already have a pretty full workload.
