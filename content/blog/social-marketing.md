Cyber Security is not something that any engineering team usually considers automatically, in the same way engineering teams rarely consider the data governance or legal implications of the product they are looking to build. The team is there to solve user stories, real or imaginary, and the external factors may be considered down the path.

The alternative is to have a Cyber Security, Data Governance, Legal and who knows what else dedicated to each team. Scaling that gets expensive fast.

I'm ok with the arrangement that these factors will be considered at some point, but the sooner you can direct a change to a product the better.

This then it makes Cyber Security's responsibility to educate engineers so that they can effect changes or ask questions early.

I wanted to explore how to improve our impact with these kinds of early communications, and one area that I had never investigated was marketing.

Marketing is an often used technique that to me has a strong association with unethical practices, which felt to me that there might be some practices of value, but to be wary since something that works for a food delivery company, might not work for 'good'. But it doesn't mean that there aren't techniques there that can be re-used.

I asked my friends in NCSC about this because they do exactly this, reach out to the general public to suggest ways to improve their security so that money and people's data doesn't get stolen.

I was initially directed towards some academic research titled [Can we well security like soap?](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Can-we-sell-security-like-soap%3A-a-new-approach-to-Ashenden-Lawrence/453101f65188b8f4bedafb3fe2fb267c969993e4#citing-papers) which is a wonderful analogy. 

The real call-out from that though is the concept of [Social Marketing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_marketing). Now I want to be clear this is different from Social Media Marketing and from searching on Amazon it also gets it mixed up.

My concern though is that a lot of this exists in academia without much grounding in the practical working world. But isn't that the point? Our responsibility as people working in Cyber Security is to take what has been writen and turn it in to something digestible to make others more effective.
