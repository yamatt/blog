Cyber Security is not something that any engineering team usually considers automatically, in the same way engineering teams rarely consider the data governance or legal implications of the product they are looking to build. The team is there to solve user stories, real or imaginary, and the external factors, such as security, may be considered down the journey.

Making cyber security integral to the path is to have a dedicated to on each team, and scaling that gets expensive fast.

I'm ok with the arrangement that security factors will be considered at some point. But the sooner you can direct a change to a product the less impact it has on the delivery.

This then makes it Cyber Security's responsibility to educate engineers so that they can effect changes or ask questions early.

This made me want to explore how to improve our impact creating intervention opporunities by communicating early. And one area that is good at making people change their decision making was marketing.

Marketing is an often used technique that to me has a strong association with unethical practices, but tweaked in the right way there might be some re-use to change people's thinking about cyber security.

I reached out to my friends in NCSC about this because they have a responsibility to do exactly this, communicate to the general public to suggest ways to improve their security so that money and people's data doesn't get stolen.

I was directed towards some academic research titled [Can we sell security like soap?](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Can-we-sell-security-like-soap%3A-a-new-approach-to-Ashenden-Lawrence/453101f65188b8f4bedafb3fe2fb267c969993e4#citing-papers) which is a wonderful analogy. 

The thing that I liked though is the concept of [Social Marketing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_marketing). Now I want to be clear this is different from Social Media Marketing and from searching on Amazon it also gets it mixed up.

My concern here is that this form of marketing seems to originate from academia without much grounding it in the practical working world. But also, isn't that the point? Our responsibility as people working in Cyber Security is to take what has been writen and turn it in to something consumable that will make others more effective.
