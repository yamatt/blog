I've seen a few discussions recently about the value of transparent security practices. Security has often seems to have fallen in to that "need to know" approach when considering controls. Can't access Miro, but can access Diagrams? Why? Is it a hard lock out? Or is it something you need to put in a request for?

These questions are difficult to know when you're simply faced with a "You can't access this message". This is a terrible user experience, and has two potential effects. It one, _should_ increase your support effort as users request access to the service, but the other, and more likely in my experience, is that users get frustrated and find an alternative. Is the alternative better? How do you measure better? It's not the thing that was blocked, but it might make your users have to work harder, expend more effort, and even less able to contribute to the business.

We see this a lot in security practices with historic contexts too.

Obviously transparency

Another form of transparency is that a system or process is sufficiently secure by default
