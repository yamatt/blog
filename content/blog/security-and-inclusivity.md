I do a lot of thining about how poor security controls impacts the culture of a business and in particular can reduce inclusivity.

By way of an example of this, and one of the common Cyber Security decisions that bugs me, is the way accounts expire after not being used for some time. Without digging in to it too much it comes about because in business it's often difficult to have a reliable leavers process. This leads to user accounts existing long after the person it was for has left the business.

As always, the best security controls involve identifying and fixing the underlying problems. In this scenario this means getting accounts blocked as part of the leavers process, making it as important as ensuring they're no-longer being paid. There will still be edge cases, and having multiple points at which long-lived accounts are detected, but solving the majority of cases will have a big impact on reducing your risk.

Automatic blocking of accounts will always be inexact and this is the cause of inclusivity problems. You will identify common absences from work such, such as maternity, or stress.

If you were that person coming back to work after time off from stress. Having to go through a support number, prove their identity, and get their account unlocked. Turning that excitement to disapointment. Does that represent your business? *Should* that represent your business?

And this is far from the only control that has this kind of impact.

<!--alex ignore obvious-->
When presented with a risk, as IT people we think about the controls we have available to us and the mitigation may seem obvious. But it takes time and research to identify the impact of it and further time and work to fix the underlying problems. Although without that work the change is to effect the culture of the business.

This makes one of the true Cyber Security responsibilities to ensure that security controls are reasonable, equitable, and justified.
