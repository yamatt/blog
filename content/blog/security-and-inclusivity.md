Over the last few weeks I have been thining about how poor security controls impacts the culture of a business and in particular can reduce inclusivity.

By way of an example of this, and one of the common Cyber Security decisions that bugs me, is the way accounts expire after not being used for some time. Without digging in to it too much it comes about because in business it's often difficult to have a reliable leavers process. This leads to user accounts existing long after the person it was for has left the business.

As always the best security controls, is to identify and fix the underlying problems. This means getting account blocked within the leavers process, making it as important as ensuring they're no-longer being paid. There will still be edge cases, and defence in depth is still important here, but solving the majority of cases will have a big impact on reducing your risk.

Any other solution will be inexact and this is the cause of inclusivity problems. If you block accounts that haven't been used for a while, you will exclude common exemptions from work such, such as maternity, or stress.

Imagine how this may feel for that person. Having to go through a support number, prove their identity, and get their account unlocked. Turning that excitement to disapointment. Does that represent your business? *Should* that represent your business?

This is far from the only control that has this kind of impact.

<!--alex ignore obvious-->
When presented with a risk, as IT people we think about the controls we have available to us and the mitigation may seem obvious. But it takes time and research to identify the impact of it. Although Without that work the change is to effect the culture of the business.

This makes the true responsibility of Cyber Security to ensure that security controls are reasonable, equitable, and justified.
