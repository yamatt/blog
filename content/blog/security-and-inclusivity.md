Over the last few weeks I have been thining about how poor security controls can impact the culture of your business and in particular can reduce inclusivity.

One of the common Cyber Security decisions that really bugs me is the way accounts expire after not being used for some time. Without digging in to it too much it comes about because having a good leavers process in a businesses tends to be difficult. The leads to user accounts existing long after the person it was for has left the business.

This causes a couple of risk to the business. One is that there ends up being many unused accounts that anyone could gain access to or even depend upon. It could also mean that if someone was unhappy when they left the business the account may end up intentionally used by untrusted people.

As is always the way with security controls, the best solution is to fix the underlying problems. This means getting the business to manage leavers properly If you trust that process everything will be more secure. Any other solution will be inexact.

But these inexact controls are exactly what causes the inclusivity issues. For example, it's really common for someone to take time off work, such as maternity, or stress. Once they're back working, they're excited and maybe a little nervous about their first day, they'll try to login to find that they can't start their work.

Imagine how this may feel for that person. Having to go through a support number, prove their identity, and get their account unlocked. Turning that excitement to disapointment. Does that represent your business? *Should* that represent your business?

This far from the only control that has this kind of impact.

<!--alex ignore obvious-->
When presented with a risk, as IT people we think about the controls we have available to us and the mitigation may seem obvious. But it takes time and research to identify the impact of it. Without that work though the change is ineffect business policy.

This makes the true responsibility of Cyber Security to ensure that security controls are reasonable, equitable, and justified.
