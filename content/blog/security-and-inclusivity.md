Over the last few weeks I have been thining about how poor security controls can impact the culture of your business and in particular impacts inclusivity.

One of the common Cyber Security decisions that really bugs me is the way accounts expire after not being used for some time. Without digging in to it too much it comes about because having a good leavers process in a businesses tends to be difficult. But the effect is that this leads to a user account existing long after the person it was for has left.

This has a couple of threats to the business. One is that there ends up being many unused accounts that anyone could gain access to or even depend upon. It could also mean that if someone was unhappy when they left the business they may be used by untrusted people.

As is always the way with security controls, the best solution is to fix the underlying problems that prevent leavers from being managed properly. Everything else is an inexact solution, such as implementing password expiry, and disabling accounts that haven't been used for a while.

But these inexact controls are exactly what causes the inclusivity issues. For example, it's really common for someone to take time off work, such as maternity, or stress. Once they're back working, they're excited and maybe a little nervous about their first day, they'll try to login to find that they can't start their work.

Imagine how this may feel for that person. Having to go through a support number, prove their identity, and get their account unlocked. Turning that excitement to disapointment. Does that represent your business? *Should* that represent your business?

This far from the only control that has this kind of impact.

When presented with a risk, as IT people we think about the controls we have available to us and the mitigation may seem obvious. But it takes time and research to identify the impact of it. Without that work the change can lead to unintended concequences.

This makes the true responsibility of Cyber Security to ensure that security controls are reasonable, equitable, and justified.
