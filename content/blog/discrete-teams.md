I recall the first thing learnt about Agile practice from someone who had done it in practice is how difficult it can be to integrate two teams working on the same project. The story goes that two teams were building a web app. One team was building the front-end and the other was building the back end. Once each teams work was complete they then wasted several cycles after ensuring that the front-end was able to talk to the back-end.

After now spending many years doing in Agile projects, and lessons from things like DevOps, the answer appears obvious. The front-end team and the back-end team should be merged and work together.

The trouble is that deciding what teams work on what part of your project is still an art more than a science.

However I my rule of thumb is that it should be one team per project. Start off by building a discrete team that is dedicated to building one thing. That team shouldn't be made of specialists. They should be a mixture of skills necessary to complete the task.
