In the programming world we have the concept of [Code Smells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell) which in it's simplest form are artefacts about some code that give the impression to the reader that the original programmer perhaps wasn't following best practice.

But looking at the broader picture, I think there are also business practices that are anti-Agile, that could be perceived as a type of "Code Smell" that doesn't apply to code, but the working practices of a business.

Much like code smells these are usually indicative, rather than authoritative examples of practice that is harming the function of your business and should be treated as somewhere to put your effort more than your blame.

Many of these practices might be known to you, and I would love it to continue the conversation to improve this list, but here is my go.

## Separate Delivery and Operations teams
This is pure DevOps stuff. The people who do the coding need to be the ones who deploy the code.

Hopefully this is rare for you, but it's a nightmare when it does occur. It creates animosity between teams, preventing safe and reliable delivery.

Work with the Operations teams as much as possible. Ensure the work they have to do is minimal and fool-proof. If something fails, it is never their fault, it is up to the delivery team to ensure a smooth roll-out.

# Gate-keepers who don't own any risk
Teams whose job it is to keep those pesky developers in-line and doing what they're supposed to be doing. These are often Design Authorities or Security Teams who tell your delivery teams what to do.

Over-coming them can be reasonably easy by keeping them as informed as possible. Invite them to your Sprint Reviews. Follow up with them as early as possible on your plans. You don't want them wielding the ban-hammer just as you're about to go live.

# Long regular meetings
Agile methodology recognises that meetings should only be done when absolutely necessary. It keeps them to a minimum so delivery teams can focus on work and minimize task switching.

By having lots of meetings you are increasing your task switching and slowing your velocity.

My experience has taught me that these meetings are a failure of the collaboration tools available to teams.

Why have a meeting when a 5 minute chat in Slack would do? Or why have an approvals process when you can use something like Jira to bake that in to your workflow.

Have a presentation? Make sure it's recorded so that others can view it at a time appropriate to them.

If you do need everyone to agree a "go moment" try and ensure all the discussion has been had before anyone sits down together so that you can keep it short.
