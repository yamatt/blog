Back in the late 90s and early 2000s people were fascinated by Japanese culture. One thing I remember vividly is how we used to find it so odd that at "celebrities" like [Sylvester Stallone](https://youtu.be/_EnFSwVV-c4) and [Arnold Schwarzenegger](https://youtu.be/6s8qn_PKbiA) doing adverts for strange products. So much so that it is even [parodied in the TV series Friends](https://youtu.be/uOy2lrJqKGY).

These days we're not even surprised when "celebrities" like [George Clooney endorsing coffee](https://youtu.be/IeQhtFS8KU0?t=14), or [Snoop Dogg rapping about take-away apps](https://youtu.be/uFPEedHvHqs).

Being a fan of Sci-Fi I'm fascinated by the idea of what we would make of technology from the future. If a smart phone from 2050 landed in your hand, what would you make of it? Would it even be recognisable? We might not be able to predict what to expect, but I think we can predict our emotional response to it.

The way we did, and still do, view Japan is the closest we get to that experience encountering revolutionary innovations. Those feelings for me are usually disbelief, of how weird, and odd it is, likely in a negative sense.

I also see that having a ZeroTrust, DevOps way of thinking is here and likely to stay, but that some people view modern engineering techniques as this odd futuristic concept that isn't worth investing in. Those people are like us, in the 90s viewing Japanese culture through a lens.

My own experience of adopting Agile way of working, is that it's a complete mind-shift from the traditional way of working. It turns so much of what you expect completely up-side-down, and encompasses so many things that are normally considered sacred, that even if you do adopt it, it's full effect cannot be reached without a holistic cultural shift in your organisation.

I hope to write about the best way I find to reach adoption soon. It certainly is a slow process and potentially generational in nature, and it cannot be done in isolation to work effectively.
