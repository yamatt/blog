Back in the late 90s and early 2000s people were fascinated by Japanese culture. One thing I remember vividly is how we used to find it so odd that at "celebrities" like [Sylvester Stallone](https://youtu.be/_EnFSwVV-c4) and [Arnold Schwarzenegger](https://youtu.be/6s8qn_PKbiA) were doing adverts for strange products in another language. So much so that it is even [parodied in the TV series Friends](https://youtu.be/uOy2lrJqKGY).

These days we're not even surprised when "celebrities" like [George Clooney endorsing coffee](https://youtu.be/IeQhtFS8KU0?t=14), or [Snoop Dogg rapping about take-away apps](https://youtu.be/uFPEedHvHqs).

Being a fan of Sci-Fi I'm fascinated by the idea of what we would make of technology from the future. If a smart phone from 2050 landed in your hand, what would you make of it? Would it even be recognisable? We might not be able to predict what to expect, but I think we can predict our emotional response to it.

I recently listened to a [Cautionary Tales episode about the Sinclair C5](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5tZWdhcGhvbmUuZm0vY2F1dGlvbmFyeXRhbGVz/episode/YjZmYjI1MzAtYWY1NS0xMWVjLWEyYTgtMmYwODg4M2JjMDJl?sa=X&ved=0CAUQkfYCahcKEwiI163Mw4T3AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAQ) in which they dramatised the launch of the C5, a "revolutionary" electric vehicle. Among a lot of it's failings, such as being completely incapable of coping with the weather of the country in which it was launched, it was also just "weird". It was unlike everything anyone had seen before. Even now, in a world with [eScooters](https://ridedott.com/ride-with-us/london) and [hoverboards](https://www.amazon.co.uk/FLYING-ANT-Hoverboard-Balancing-Certified-Green-bluetooth/dp/B08GFQ5FVS), it's a very strange transport mechanism.

I also see that having a ZeroTrust and DevOps mindset is here and very likely to stay, but that some people view modern engineering techniques as this odd, alien, concept that completely upsets everything that has gone before it. Those people are like us, viewing Japanese culture through a lens of "well this is weird".

My own experience of adopting Agile is that it's a complete mind-shift from the traditional way of working. It turns so much of what you are taught, by companies, by society, and by universities, completely up-side-down. It also changes so many things outside your team, things that are normally considered sacred, like how finance and procurement work, that even if you do adopt it, it's full effect cannot be reached without a holistic cultural shift in your organisation.

Remembering those early days is important, to remember how you felt, how you got to a stage where you were comfortable, and to use those "aha!" moments to bring others on the journey with you.

I hope to write about the best way I find to achieve adoption soon. Implementing Agile methodologies across a business certainly is a slow process and potentially generational in nature, and it cannot be done in isolation to work effectively. But I hope that this gives you a sense of sympathy towards those who may not have even heard of it.
