An employee dreads little more than when they're requsted to do _mandatory training_, and yet it's a typical tool that Cyber Security teams use to put a tick in the compliance box.

But putting a tick in a box does not make a business safer. You need to [provide pragmatic and actionable advice to convince the business to consider the risks that it's taking](./security-communication.md). [There is work being in the Cyber Security to make the training more effective](./social-marketing.md).

On top of that the optimal result of providing training, is making a person or team aware of the risks of their job, and the optimal result of this is that they will realise they have to add more checks to their process, increasing conative load and slowing their work.
