I have a friend who works in a similar industry. He has a mantra "be better". It's a sort of half joke half truth that there are a lot of people working in cyber security who make terrible decisions.

I was reminded recently of Homer Simpson, as a safety inspector, to "Saften Up".

I also received an e-mail not too long ago saying to protect your car to "add a tracker to it".

[Here's another one from the NSA](https://twitter.com/NSACyber/status/1628455374163517442) telling people to 'secure their routers'

All of these requests are sensible on the surface, there's nothing wrong with identifying the problem.

The issue is the follow through. How do you enact these requests? And if you don't know how to enact these requests, do they have any value? And if they don't have any value, why should anyone listen?

We live in a complex world. People have a finite amount of time to improve their situation. If a requst is not followed up by a way to enact a problem, you at best have wasted someones time and at worst, have added to more 'noise' about cyber security without providing any 'signal'. Meaning people are less likely to engage with your advice.
