One of the things that was very important to me when putting together this blog is to use CI/CD techniques to improve the quality of my posts. In fact so much so that I had to build 2 libraries [textstat-cli](https://github.com/yamatt/python3-textstat-cli) and [haemoglogin](https://github.com/yamatt/python3-hemoglobin), to make it possible.

Discovering tools to make my writing more effective started off as a conversation with a colleague who pointed me towards Alex.js - a tool that looks for insensitive writing. Fortunately it was trivial to include in the pipeline, however I also wanted to know how long my posts were, how complex they are to read, and, since I'm writing this in an IDE, any grammatical improvements that wouldn't get picked up outside of a word processor.

One of the interesting artefacts of having all these tests though is how it makes me think more about my writing. I am much more conscious of the language I use even before I hit 'push'. I'll quickly remove whole sentences for the sake of brevity.
