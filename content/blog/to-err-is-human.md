I was driving with a friend of mine, not long after I passed my driving test. We were chatting and he described something to me that stuck with me.

We were on a motorway and there was traffic ahead. He wanted me to move to the lane over because of the traffic, but I didn't. He didn't understand why, until the police car came zooming past.

Driving is entirely a matter of perspective.

I've been enjoying watching videos recently of people doing very odd things while driving. Even the commentator, a driving instructor, is frustrated by some of the things people do in these videos. It's understandable, you are driving a weapon and you have to be alert at all times. But also, you don't know the other persons perspective.

Yes, maybe they are tired, maybe this is the 3rd time they've had to drive to hospital in as many days because their partner is ill and they don't have any other choice. It's not an excuse, it's human. And modern cars account for this. NCAP ratings are based upon the technology in a car that detects and prevents accidents from happening. Not all, but some of them.

You see someone do something strange on the road and you give them room to do that strange thing rather than putting yourself in the way, making things worse.

What on earth does this have to do with Cyber Security. Well, instead of NCAP we have Cyber Essentials. Instead of a protective shell in a car, seatbelts, airbags and accident detection, you could call this defence in depth.

People driving over the speed limit? They're hackers. Circumventing the laws and rules that we tend to abide by to their own end.

And people make mistakes. You make mistakes. Would you want should we shout and rage? Or accept that is something that people do and account for it. That's Cyber Security.
