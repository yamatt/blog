To say I've been enjoying watching YouTube videos about car accidents and near misses isn't quite correct. It's been eye opening and shocking.

A lot of these videos are surrounded by commentary saying that there were clues or things that the driver could have done to make things easier for themselves, but there are many times where I'm watching the video and thinking I wouldn't have done as well as the driver in that situation.

I've also seen examples where people have said if someone doesn't know, x or y then they should just hand in your license.

I've had similar sounding conversations about Cyber Security. That users shouldn't be allowed near a computer and it was obvious they shouldn't have clicked on the phishing e-mail.

But life just isn't as simple as that.

Both driving and using a computer are often a necessity of work. Both have complicated and extensive rules and guidance that no one can realistically apply at all times and even if you memorised it all, you're tasked with having to make instant decisions with very little input from anyone else.

In the land of cars they've taken an approach that is very familiar to those of us who work in IT. They put proactive technical controls in place to make accidents less likely to happen. For example, recent NCAP changes [require cars to detect a stopped vehicle in-front of them](https://www.euroncap.com/en/vehicle-safety/the-ratings-explained/safety-assist/aeb-car-to-car/). Curiously the name of this safety technology has a name with a 3 letter acronym that makes no sense to anyone outside of the industry. There's something reasuringly familiar about that.

As usual the failure is not with people, people are faliable, and regularly wrong. Usually without realising it. The failure is with not applying technology to assist in making people's lives easier. It's about seeing it from the perspective of the person. Were the signs unclear? Was the training not good enough or too long ago?

But failures make a better story, news article, or YouTube video. It's natural to be attracted to them. But the story actually about the failure, it's about what was learnt from it.
