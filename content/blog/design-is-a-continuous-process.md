While having a discussion about ADRs recently, and how they map to design, and what that means for an Enterprise Design Authority, I came to the realisation, perhaps later than everyone else, that design is a continuous process. It then got me thinking that this is a basic tenant of the Agile methodology. Everything that Agile does, and is, every methodology, working practice, and process is there to make design happen throughout the project.
