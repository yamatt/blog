Having worked previously for one company that prioritised control and order at expense of adaptation, to another company that believes in autonomy and collaborative working, it made real something that I have been toying with for some time, and that is that innovation and chaos are highly intertwined, and in an environment that attempts to enforce control over chaos, that chaos is, eventually, unavoidable.

As a society we're generally taught to design and deliver, and then get very confused when that doesn't work.

If you've not experienced that, then, I would argue, you have been fortunate enough to have been working with people who have been hiding when things didn't go to plan. This, in many ways, is an example of an agile methodology in action. Taking a plan and adapting it when it turned out not to go as planned.

Or, acknowledging that the end result is a compromise between the vision, recognising the assumptions within that vision, and the reality of the delivery.

If you plan to maintain that vision with no compromises, you are planning to fail.

Delivering any IT solution, and particularly IT security, for the last 30 years has been about a fixed structure and solution without considering the context and environment. In some areas that model is struggling, because it does not adapt to modern agile delivery.
