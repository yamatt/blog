A  recent [Cyber Weekly](https://cyberweekly.substack.com/p/cyberweekly-174-one-team-two-team) mentioned Green Teams in the context of security and Red Teams and Blue Teams as team who have a security responsibility, and this got me thinking, extending the [Greenfield products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield_project) analogy to the [Brownfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownfield_(software_development%29) terminology, and having _Brown teams_. The idea being of a team that is responsible for an existing, likely legacy product. Although the name is problematic.

The name isn't so much a description of what they do, but a reflection of their responsibilities. By which I mean you cannot become a Green or Brown Team, you are working on a product that didn't exist before (Green) or a product that has existed for some time and may well be legacy (Brown).

The categorisation is useful because as the article points out, we often don't spend significant time thinking about the issues these teams face, and they require very different working practices to get them to a good place.
