The ideal outcome for a Cyber Security team is to make teams within the business more aware of the risks they carry in their work.
Those teams should then be empowered to change their processes to manage the risks better. This usually (although not always) requires additional steps, addional cognitive load, and additional work.

A busy team, who are struggling with their existing workload, may not appreciate you cheerfully turning up and adding to their existing work.

Their ability to take on this additional work, I like to think of this as _The Reservoir of Good Will_.

To explain in more detail, **Good will** is the concept of doing something with no expectation of getting something in return. In most interpersonal relationships there is some level of trust. Trust that someone isn't going to exploit you and is asking for genuine help.

A **reservoir** is a body of water used for storage. The levels of water go up as more water enters it, and is drained to produce a valuable resource, such as hydro-electric power or drinking water.

The Reservoir of Good Will is an analogy to allow Cyber Secruty teams to think about how making requests on a business affects that business.

When a Cyber Security team makes a request of a business, it takes the person or team away from doing the thing they're already doing. It drains something from that reservoir.

Some teams have a larger reserviour. They have more capacity to take on the inconvenience of the thing you ask. Some, have a smaller reserviour, and may struggle.

As people practicing Cyber Security, our responsibility is to ensure we keep each reservoir topped up. We can take sips or gulps from the reservoir, but we must be mindful of how much we let it drain.

However, if the reservoir gets too full, we are not being fulfiling our role to the business of keeping it as secure as it could be. We will always need to dip in to that reservoir a bit.

We need to keep that reservoir at a good level. But we don’t know what a good level is, how much of that reservoir a task will drain, and we don’t know where our levels are at any time.

Therefore we must be cautious and poll the levels and make sure our actions are kept at the right amount to sustain each person and team, and we need to size our activities to see if they are going to take too big of a glug.
