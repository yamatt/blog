It can be difficult to measure the effectiveness and success of Cyber Security at scale.

[US President Regan is commonly believed to be the first to say](https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/25691/what-did-reagan-mean-when-he-said-the-nine-most-terrifying-words-in-the-englis):

> The nine most terrifying words in the English language are "I'm from the government, and I'm here to help." 

Similarly nothing sends dread through a employees more than 'mandatory training', especially if it's about Cyber Security.

A Cyber Security team within a business has to find ways to [convince the business to consider the risks that it's taking](./security-communication.md). You can provide training and guidance to teams as much as you like, but those taking it are the ones who have to action it. [There is work being in the Cyber Security to make the training more effective](./social-marketing.md).

But an area that I don't see covered is now willing people within the business are to accept the training in the first place.

I like to think of this as the reservoir of good will.

'Good will' is the concept of doing something on faith. Maybe sometimes a team is down a person and you stand in for that person. A one off is fine. Then you find that person goes away a lot, and you find that team starts to depend on you. Your own work builds up. You make compromises and without careful communication between you, and the other team, you end up with ill will.

Your reservoir has been used up. That other team have drained it. It will refill over time. A few months later, that person who was off is back, you manage to fend off the odd request. It naturally goes back to a state of good will with that other team.

When Cyber Security teams make a request of a business, you are draining a little bit from that reservoir. The reservoir tends to refill again over time, but every time we ask someone to take an action it drains that reservoir a little.

It's also a little more complicated. Each person can have their own reservoir, but those people talk, and people in their teams will notice it collectively. So each team has it's own reservoir too. Plus the business itself has a reservoir. If you give everyone a large long task to do. Let's say a week long ransomware exercise. That will impact the business from making money because people are doing that exercise and not their jobs.

As Cyber Security our responsibility is to ensure we keep each reservoir topped up. We can take sips or gulps from the reservoir, but we must be mindful of letting it drain too far. On the other hand, if the reservoir gets too full, we are not keeping the business as secure as it could be. We need to dip in to that reservoir a bit.

We need to keep that reservoir at an optimum level, but we don’t know what that optimum is, how much of that reservoir that task will drain, and we don’t know where our levels are any one time.

Therefore we should poll our levels regularly and make sure our actions are kept at the right amount for each person, team, and for the organisation. We need to measure our activities to see if they are going to take too big of a glug.
