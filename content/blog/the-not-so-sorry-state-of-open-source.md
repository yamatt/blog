I've seen a few discussions recently bemoaning the state of Open Source software. This seems likely to have been brought on by questions of their security and integrity in light of many recent concerns about supply chain exploits.

I will declare myself now, I am not a fan of Java. In my personal ranking of programming languages I hate Java is there right below PHP. So I will admit with the log4j issues over the weekend I have been quietly smirking to myself a bit. Although it goes without saying, #hugops to those who have had their weekends ruined.

However, I do recognise that ranking them comes from my personal biases and is not backed up by any data. It does not [make the Java (or PHP) ecosystem insecure](./assessing-security-practices-of-3rd-party-projects).

I'm sure this reasoning can also be applied to those with concerns about the security of Open Source software. Those who are lashing out with whatever their personal biases tell them without any considered reasoning.

However, given the prevalence and severity of the log4j issues what would concern me is environments that are difficult to update. I do recognise that we are in a time of transition right now. A lot of software is still manually deployed, if the engineers who built it are still working for the company. And even the ones that are automatically deployed may not fully understand the tooling within them. I'm sure much like Heartbleed the fixes will be gradual rather than big bang.

Hopefully this will be another opportunity for businesses to have the discussion "what can we do to prevent this from happening again?" and do some fish-bone analysis rather than finding someone or something to blame.
