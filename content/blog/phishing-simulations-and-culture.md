My good friend Joel recently wrote a widely shared post on [why phishing simulations just don't work](https://joelgsamuel.medium.com/what-i-mean-by-defence-in-depth-cybersecurity-6ac07f89ad89). This itself follows on from many discussions with [our good friend Emma](https://twitter.com/EmmaWicksCyber) on how phishing cannot be over-come by will-power.

But the area I think has also been missing from the discussion so far is what phishing simlations mean for your business culture.

Many business these days will strive for inclusivity and diversity. Done successfully this will increase innovation, and improve adaptation within the business. But to make it effective means providing employees with psychological safety to identiy exclusionary thinking, and report toxic culuture throughout the business.

[This is important to Cyber Security too](https://cyberempathy.org/episodes/creating-psychological-safety-in-cybersecurity). We must create a culture where people feel safe to report suspicious activity, even in cases of uncertainty.

I wanted to contrast this with the way phishing simulations are often managed, and give a sense about the effects, particularly to those subjected to them.

Phishing simulations are effective when someone slips up and clicks on a link in an e-mail. Joel and Emma have very effectively discussed the reasons for this, what happens after this is also important.

Typically the individual user will be sent to a page advising them of their mistake, and possibly offer some advice. That's the best case scenario.

I know in some businesses maybe you get a talking to from a manager, or sent on mandatory training.

Let's take email out of this entirely. This is the equivalent of working in a post room. You get post in. You put it in the right pigeon holes, and you deliver it to the people who need it. Your line manager decides to put in some dummy post, to check how _effective_ you're being.

I hope no one has experienced this, but it's distrustful. I would call this micro-managing.

I know from being my own experience in phishing simulations, it's like working with the fear of an axe able to jump out at you at any time. We should be looking at ways of reducing that fear, and increasing trust, not having Cyber Security teams adding to the collective anxiety.
