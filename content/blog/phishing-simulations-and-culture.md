My good friend Joel recently wrote a widely shared post on [why phishing simulations just don't work](https://joelgsamuel.medium.com/what-i-mean-by-defence-in-depth-cybersecurity-6ac07f89ad89). This itself follows on from many discussions from my good friend Emma on how phishing cannot be over-come by will-power.

But I wanted to dig in a bit on what phishing simlations mean for your business culture.

Many business these days will strive for inclusivity and diversity within their employees. Done successfully this will increase innovation, and improve adaptation within the business. But to achieve this you need the right business culture. This means to effectively handle reports of toxic culuture within the business, to stop the spread of exclusionary thinking.

This is important to Cyber Security too. We want to create a culture where people feel safe to report suspicious activity, even in cases of uncertainty.

I wanted to contrast this with what phishing simulations are to those who are the victim of them.

A scenario that phishing simulations make me think of. You work in a post room. You get post in. You put it in the right pigeon holes, and you deliver it to the people who need it. Your line manager decides to put in some dummy post, to check how effective you're being. They don't ask you if it's OK to do that. They don't look at other ways of measuring your effectiveness. How would that make you feel?

Let's say you work in an admin job. You have multiple responsibilities, but mostly entering data in to a system. Your line manager comes over every few days and checks over your work. Leans over your shoulder and stops you from working. Sits down and double checks what you've entered. I hope no one has experienced this, but it's distrustful. I would call this micro-managing.

Phishing simulations have a very similar cultural effect.

From being subjected to them myself, they're anxiety inducing. It feels like you're being tested at all times, without warning.

It's like working with an axe jumping out at you at any time.
