My good friend Joel recently wrote a widely shared post on [why phishing simulations just don't work](https://joelgsamuel.medium.com/what-i-mean-by-defence-in-depth-cybersecurity-6ac07f89ad89). This itself follows on from many discussions with [our good friend Emma](https://twitter.com/EmmaWicksCyber) on how phishing cannot be over-come by will-power.

But the area I think has also been missing from the discussion so far is what phishing simlations mean for your business culture.

Many business these days will strive for inclusivity and diversity within their employees. Done successfully this will increase innovation, and improve adaptation within the business. It means providing employees psychological safety to identiy exclusionary thinking, and handle effectively the reports of toxic culuture throughout the business.

This is important to Cyber Security too. We must create a culture where people feel safe to report suspicious activity, even in cases of uncertainty.

I wanted to contrast this with the typical handling of phishing simulations are to those who are the victim of them.

Most phishing simulations are effective when someone slips up and clicks on a link in an e-mail. Joel and [Emma have very effectively discussed the reasons for this](https://cyberempathy.org/episodes/creating-psychological-safety-in-cybersecurity). But the following stages are also important.

Typically the individual user will be sent to a page advising them of their mistake, and possibly offer some advice. That's the best case scenario. Maybe you get a talking to from a manager, or get sent on mandatory training.

Let's take phishing out of this. This is the equivalent of working in a post room. You get post in. You put it in the right pigeon holes, and you deliver it to the people who need it. Your line manager decides to put in some dummy post, to check how effective you're being. How would that make you feel?

I know from being involved in phishing simulations it makes me feel stressed and not trusted.

But that's not the end of it. Back at phishing, it's someone is looking at the data as well. How many people clicked? How many people reported as phishing?

But what do these metrics actually tell you? How good your phishing simulation was? Or how bad your staff or teams are? The trick there is that shouldn't it be telling you how **good** they are? What if they were busy that week or day? Is this data accurate or reliable? Does it equate to real world tests? Where is the data on that?

Let's say you work in a data entry job. You have multiple responsibilities, but mostly entering data in to a system. Your line manager comes over every few days and checks over your work. Leans over your shoulder and stops you from working. Sits down and double checks what you've entered. I hope no one has experienced this, but it's distrustful. I would call this micro-managing.

Phishing simulations have a very similar cultural effect to your business. They take a big chunk out of your [Reservoir of Good Will](./the-reservoir-of-good-will.md).

From being subjected to them myself, they're anxiety inducing. It feels like you're being tested at all times, without warning.

It's like working with an axe jumping out at you at any time.
