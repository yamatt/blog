&lt;p>You may well ask what my favourite thing was. Actually, it was the talk &lt;em>How to implement AWS cost optimization strategy that works&lt;/em> talk by Steph Gooch from AWS and David Andrews from Just Eat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why? FinOps has limited relationship to security unless someone is running a crypto miner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because I see that FinOps and Cyber Security (and Data Governance) share a lot of the same ways of working. That being, trying to convince developers to do things that are not always on their journey to delivering a useful product.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m ok with that too. Security is it&amp;rsquo;s own journey and, being pragmatic, it needs to be added when it&amp;rsquo;s needed. But our job is to check in with the teams as close as possible to the time when it&amp;rsquo;s needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I enjoyed most about the talk is that the language used is not tainted by years of treating humans as the problem rather than the solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;!--alex ignore fear-->
&lt;p>Securing IT systems has been around a long time and has it&amp;rsquo;s roots and language in the military and academia which aren&amp;rsquo;t neceserily reflective of how a business operates. For security to be effective we need to reduce the fear of security, and using agressive language is one way to improve adoption.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>FinOps does not have any of this baggage being at most &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121005123855/http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/">a few decades old&lt;/a>. So it&amp;rsquo;s refreshing to see how a relatively clean slate can work and inspire developers to care about the thing that you care about.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Phishing Simulations and Culture</title><link>https://matt.copperwaite.net/blog/phishing-simulations-and-culture/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2023 18:10:32 +0000</pubDate><author>matt@copperwaite.net (Matt Copperwaite)</author><guid>https://matt.copperwaite.net/blog/phishing-simulations-and-culture/</guid><description>&lt;p>My good friend Joel wrote a widely shared post on &lt;a href="https://joelgsamuel.medium.com/what-i-mean-by-defence-in-depth-cybersecurity-6ac07f89ad89">why phishing simulations don&amp;rsquo;t work&lt;/a>. This itself follows on from excellent discussions with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EmmaWicksCyber">our good friend Emma&lt;/a>, on how phishing cannot be over-come by will-power.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the area I think has also been missing from the discussion so far is, what phishing simlations mean for your business culture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Business these days will strive for inclusivity and diversity. When done well this increases innovation, and improves your buisness ability to adapt. But improving diversity in a business doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen in isolation. It&amp;rsquo;s supported by providing employees with the psychological safety, the ability to identiy exclusionary thinking, and tools to report and respond to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://cyberempathy.org/episodes/creating-psychological-safety-in-cybersecurity">This culture is important to Cyber Security too&lt;/a>. We must create a culture where people feel safe to report suspicious activity, even (or especially) in cases of uncertainty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted to contrast this with the way phishing simulations are often managed, and give a sense about the effects on employees, focusing on those subjected to them.&lt;/p>
&lt;!--alex ignore fear-->
&lt;p>Phishing simulations, first off, create a culture of fear with people accessing their e-mail. This expresses itself as stress. I think this is particuarly accute where your role requires you to have access to more systems. This stress does not help with the feeling of psychological safety within a business.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also a phishing simulation is most effective when someone slips up and clicks on a link in an e-mail. Joel and Emma have discussed the reasons for this, but what happens after this is also important.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Typically the user will be directed to a page advising them of their mistake, and possibly offer some advice. That&amp;rsquo;s the best case scenario.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know in some businesses the follow-on is getting a talking to from a manager, or sent on mandatory training. Perhaps different people or teams within the business, are ranked against each other in the hope that this will cause them to perform better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Really this pits one group of people against another creating a sense of &amp;lsquo;otherness&amp;rsquo;, adding to stress and lack of inclusivity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is additional stress. Stress makes people more liable to make mistakes. The stress of an exam does not make you better able to do well at the exam. Except the exam is happening every time you open your inbox.&lt;/p>
&lt;!--alex ignore dummy-->
&lt;p>Think I&amp;rsquo;m exagerating? Let&amp;rsquo;s take email out of this entirely. This is the equivalent of working in a post room. You get post in. You put it in the right pigeon-holes, and you deliver it to the people who need it. Your line manager decides to put in some dummy post, to check how &lt;em>effective&lt;/em> you&amp;rsquo;re being. They check if the dummy post is delivered to the right place and in a way the manager is happy with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope no one has experienced this, but it&amp;rsquo;s disrespectful and distrustful. I would call this micro-managing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know from my own experience in phishing simulations, it&amp;rsquo;s like working with a chance of an axe jumping out at you at any time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We should be looking at ways of reducing that stress, and increasing trust. Allowing people to come forward with concerns about their e-mail. Not having a distrustful relationship with their Cyber Security team, that should be helping them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s allow people to make mistakes, and give them the clarity of thought to idenify the mistake and learn from it. Not telling them off for something doing wrong.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Reservoir of Good Will</title><link>https://matt.copperwaite.net/blog/the-reservoir-of-good-will/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jul 2023 21:10:32 +0000</pubDate><author>matt@copperwaite.net (Matt Copperwaite)</author><guid>https://matt.copperwaite.net/blog/the-reservoir-of-good-will/</guid><description>&lt;p>The ideal outcome for a Cyber Security team is to make the teams within the business more aware of the risks they carry in their work, and for those teams to react and change their processes to manage the risks better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This change in process usually (although not always) requires the team to either add extra steps, or increase cognitive load, and slows their work. Having to do this work, separate from the work itself, damages the relationship a little with Cyber Security teams.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A busy team, who are struggling with their existing workload, may not appreciate you cheerfully turning up and adding to their existing work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A teams ability to take on additional work, I like to call the &lt;em>The Reservoir of Good Will&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To explain in more detail, a &lt;strong>reservoir&lt;/strong> is a body of water used for storage. The levels of water go up as more water enters it such as rain or snow, and is drained to produce a valuable resource, such as hydro-electric power or drinking water.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Good will&lt;/strong> is the concept of doing something with no expectation of getting something in return.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Reservoir of Good Will is an analogy to allow Cyber Secruty teams to think about how making requests on a team affects the relationship with that team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When a Cyber Security team makes a request of a business, it takes the team away from doing the thing they&amp;rsquo;re expecting to do, leading to a level of frustration. It drains some good will from their reservoir.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some teams have a larger reserviour. They have more capacity to take on the inconvenience of the thing you ask. Some, have a smaller reserviour, and may struggle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As people practicing Cyber Security, our responsibility is to ensure we keep the reservoir of each team topped up. We can take sips or gulps from the reservoir, but we must be mindful by how much it is drained.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, if the reservoir gets too full, we are not fulfiling our responsibilities to the business of keeping it as secure as it could be. We will always need to dip in to that reservoir a bit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We need to keep that reservoir at a good level, and to do that we need to understand where that level is. We must measure it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore we must be cautious and poll the levels and make sure our actions are kept at the right amount to sustain each team, and we need to understand the size our activities to see if they are going to be too big of a glug.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Keys, Secrets, and Tokens</title><link>https://matt.copperwaite.net/blog/keys-tokens-secrets/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2023 18:10:32 +0000</pubDate><author>matt@copperwaite.net (Matt Copperwaite)</author><guid>https://matt.copperwaite.net/blog/keys-tokens-secrets/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have spent some of my time over the last 12 months working out how to improve our response to, first the &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/04/21/github-stolen-oauth-tokens-used-in-breaches/">Heroku leaks&lt;/a>, followed later by the &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/lastpass-engineer-breach-security-roundup/">LastPass leaks&lt;/a>, closely followed by the &lt;a href="https://circleci.com/blog/january-4-2023-security-alert/">CircleCI leaks&lt;/a>. Each of which took a significant amount of time to resolve, time that could have spent improving the features and capability of our main product.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Something I identified, as part of this response, was that as engineers, have several names for things that are very closely related, namely, Keys, Secrets and Tokens, there might even be others. I think any seasoned engineer will recognise that they do refer to different things, after all, we have &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">AWS KMS&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html">AWS Secrets Manager&lt;/a>. But an IAM User has &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html">both keys and secrets&lt;/a> and that keys is a different kind of key to the KMS key.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having a common language reduces change fatigue and rework when a problem that everyone who thought they understood a problem discovered that they didn&amp;rsquo;t. This way we can have better confidence in the outcomes of the problem we&amp;rsquo;re discussing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I needed a way of describing, without significant friction, a way to refer to values that are used by systems to interoperate (i.e.: not a password), are sensitive, and need careful management.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I decided that the best word to encompass this was &lt;em>Secret&lt;/em>. It seemed like it had more meaning, in a more succinct way than any of the other terms available.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I proposed this to our business via our usual engineering approvals board and it got accepted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not to say that the usage of the word Key, or Token is banned, but that Secret emcompassed them all. The word &lt;em>Secret&lt;/em> could also mean a key or a token. Something sensitive that needs protecting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are likely differences in each business that may mean that &lt;em>secret&lt;/em> isn&amp;rsquo;t the right word for you, but having at least an awareness how these words mean similar, or different things can be helpful.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Social Marketing</title><link>https://matt.copperwaite.net/blog/social-marketing/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Mar 2023 18:10:32 +0000</pubDate><author>matt@copperwaite.net (Matt Copperwaite)</author><guid>https://matt.copperwaite.net/blog/social-marketing/</guid><description>&lt;p>Cyber Security is not something that many engineering teams consider automatically, in the same way that it&amp;rsquo;s common that engineering teams rarely consider the data governance or legal implications of the product they are looking to build. The team is there to solve user stories, real or imaginary, and the external factors, such as security, may only be considered once on the journey to delivery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As security people we recognise that directing changes early has the lowest impact on delivery. But making cyber security integral to the delivery path is to have a dedicated person on each team gets expensive fast. Either as additional effort for each team, or as gatekeepers blocking releases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead cyber security teams must accept that security will be included in the delivery at some point and make it our responsibility to intervene and educate engineers so that they can effect changes, or ask questions, as early as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This thinking made me want to explore how to create more intervention opporunities by improving communication in the early stages of a delivery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One industry that I realised is good at making people change their thinking was marketing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Marketing, to me, has a strong association with unethical practices, but tweaked in the right way I wanted to see if there might be some re-usable techniques to change people&amp;rsquo;s thinking about cyber security.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I reached out to my friends in NCSC because they have a responsibility to do exactly this, communicate to the general public to suggest ways to improve their security so that money and people&amp;rsquo;s data doesn&amp;rsquo;t get stolen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From there I was directed towards some academic research titled &lt;a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Can-we-sell-security-like-soap%3A-a-new-approach-to-Ashenden-Lawrence/453101f65188b8f4bedafb3fe2fb267c969993e4#citing-papers">Can we sell security like soap?&lt;/a> which is a wonderful analogy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The thing that I liked though is the concept of &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_marketing">Social Marketing&lt;/a>. As a side note, I want to be clear this is different from Social Media Marketing, and while looking for books on Amazon it also gets it mixed up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately I&amp;rsquo;ve not yet been able to identify a set of guidelines that help me. A lot of what I&amp;rsquo;ve read so far seems to originate from academia without much grounding it in the practical working world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But perhaps that&amp;rsquo;s the point. As people working in Cyber Security our responsibility is to take what has been writen and turn it in to something consumable that will make others more effective.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Security and Inclusivity</title><link>https://matt.copperwaite.net/blog/security-and-inclusivity/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2023 09:40:32 +0000</pubDate><author>matt@copperwaite.net (Matt Copperwaite)</author><guid>https://matt.copperwaite.net/blog/security-and-inclusivity/</guid><description>&lt;p>I do a lot of thinking about second and third order effects, and how poor security controls impacts the culture of a business and in particular can reduce inclusivity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By way of an example of this, and the common Cyber Security control that most annoys me, is the way accounts expire after not being used for some time. Without digging in to the background too much it comes about because in business it&amp;rsquo;s often difficult to have a reliable leavers process. This leads to user accounts existing long after its owner has left the business.&lt;/p>
&lt;!--alex ignore maternity-paternity-->
&lt;p>Automatic blocking of accounts will always be inexact and this is the cause of inclusivity problems. You will identify common absences from work such, such as maternity, or stress.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The true answer in this scenario is to get accounts blocked as part of the leavers process, making it as important as ensuring they&amp;rsquo;re no-longer being paid. This will have a big impact on reducing the risk to your business.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There will still be edge cases, and it&amp;rsquo;s worth including additional steps to detect long-lived accounts. You can also apply an human action of verifying if the account is still needed. You could even automate this by sending an e-mail to a line manager that explains the risks and impact, asking them to click a link if the account can be blocked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you were that person coming back to work after time off from stress. Having to go through a support number, prove their identity, and get their account unlocked. Turning that excitement to disapointment. Does that represent your business? &lt;em>Should&lt;/em> that represent your business?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And this is far from the only control that has this kind of impact.&lt;/p>
&lt;!--alex ignore obvious-->
&lt;p>When presented with a risk, as IT people we think about the controls we have available to us and the mitigation may seem obvious. It takes time and research to identify the impact of it and further time and work to fix the underlying problems. Although without that work the change is to effect the culture of the business.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This makes one of the true Cyber Security responsibilities to ensure that security controls are reasonable, equitable, and justified.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Safety and Security</title><link>https://matt.copperwaite.net/blog/safety-and-security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2022 18:10:32 +0000</pubDate><author>matt@copperwaite.net (Matt Copperwaite)</author><guid>https://matt.copperwaite.net/blog/safety-and-security/</guid><description>&lt;!--alex disable shit fuck -->

&lt;p>It is dark. You hear a beep.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is dark. Another beep.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You check the time. It&amp;rsquo;s almost 2.30am.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another beep.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is that?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Is it from outside?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You open a window and wait.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You hear a beep.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not outside. That must mean it&amp;rsquo;s inside. That means it&amp;rsquo;s your problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are lots of things it &lt;em>could&lt;/em> be. They&amp;rsquo;re all over the house. From the fridge to the carbon monoxide detectors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bleary eyed you stalk around the house, stopping occasionally to see if you can hear the direction of the beep.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Going in to one room, doubling back on yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eventually. A beep above your head. A smoke alarm. Of course it is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your child is asleep in the next room. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t sleep well. You have to silence the smoke alarm quickly and quietly.&lt;/p>
&lt;!--alex ignore fire -->
&lt;p>What does the beeping mean? The house is not on fire. You happened to have gone around the house already.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The beeping could mean anything. You don&amp;rsquo;t know the cause. Your mind races. The smoke alarm is mains powered. The smoke alarm could have lost power. Did you do anything recently that might have caused the smoke alarm to have lost power? Has there been a power cut? Could the battery have lost power? Does it have a battery? &lt;em>Should&lt;/em> the battery have lost power if it&amp;rsquo;s been running off mains? How would the smoke alarm know the battery is dying if it mains powered, it isn&amp;rsquo;t using it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You check online for anything else it could be. It&amp;rsquo;s 3 am. You want to sleep, not diagnose a beeping smoke alarm that will wake up your family.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are loads of websites giving you lots of options depending on the type of smoke alarm you have and the kind of beep it&amp;rsquo;s making. You don&amp;rsquo;t know the make and model of my smoke alarm, they came with the house.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apparently it&amp;rsquo;s common for batteries to start failing during the night when the tempurature drops, causing the battery to be less effective.&lt;/p>
&lt;!--alex ignore fire just -->
&lt;p>All the smoke alarms are on their own circuit. You could turn the whole thing off and worry about it in the morning. It seems unlikely there would happen to be a fire just then. But would that make things worse? Would the smoke alarm keep working off their batteries and drain them faster causing more of them to beep? Would it set all the smoke alarms off as a failsafe?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your best bet is to replace the battery. &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0c2g9kr">Often people don&amp;rsquo;t know&lt;/a> that a beeping smoke alarm means the battery needs replacing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Is there a spare? Yes. Fortunately. Lets not think about what you would do if that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s also fortunate this is not one that needs a massive ladder to reach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now how do you replace the battery? How do you open the smoke alarm?&lt;/p>
&lt;!--alex ignore hole -->
&lt;p>Written on the smoke alarm is an obscure instruction about pushing a screwdriver in to a hole on the side. Looks like you&amp;rsquo;ll need to find a screwdriver then. Why do you need to find a screwdriver at 3.30am? Fortunately you know where one is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You follow the instructions. The smoke alarm is slightly too close to the wall and the screwdriver almost doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit. You still cannot work out how to get the old battery out. Your arms are so tired from holding them above my head for so long.&lt;/p>
&lt;!--alex ignore angry -->
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;re frustrated, angry. You lose it. You pull on the case. Maybe there is a way in. After easing it a bit, it comes away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No access to the battery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fuck.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At least now you can see how you &lt;em>would&lt;/em> get to the draw that holds the battery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a bit of prying a draw pops out and the battery drops out of the draw.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Replace the battery. Put the draw back in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No beeping?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Go back to bed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The adrenaline is surging.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;re waiting for the next beep. Was that a beep?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You stay awake until your son wakes at 6.30am.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-next-morning">The next morning&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Your electrician advises that there are very high voltages in the smoke alarm due to the electronics used to check for smoke. Removing the case was dangerous. It is best to replace the unit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given no one knows the age or history of any of the smoke alarms and that you have a young family you make the decision to replace them all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The electrician recommends the most popular brand. It&amp;rsquo;s the exact same model you already have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At least you know how to replace the battery now.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="coda">Coda&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For the UK the regulations used to say that, when adding a loft extension to your house, that all doors were replaced with firedoors that self close.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People found all the doors in your house being closed was inconvenient, this lead to people propping the doors open. So the regulations were changed to install smoke alarms in all rooms that are linked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is incredibly sensible and pragmatic advice that responds to people&amp;rsquo;s real-world usage of safety equipment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When talking about security I regularly like to frame it to the world of safety. Safety is tangible and people like talking about safety. But I recognise that they&amp;rsquo;re often not directly comparable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Safety equipment is often tied to a regulations that can be complex and expensive to change. But safety equipment can also have the same failings as a lot of security products do. Poor documentation. Poor user experience, especially when things go really wrong. Poor quality alerts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to build good, reliable, and accurate equipment you need to think about how they fail, and how your users will over-come the failure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because right now I don&amp;rsquo;t want smoke alarms in my house. I would rather have a relaxing and peaceful night sleep. I won&amp;rsquo;t be alone in that motiviation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wish this story was not based on real events.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reminiscing over the OWASP Top 10</title><link>https://matt.copperwaite.net/blog/reminiscing-over-the-owasp-top-10/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2022 14:10:32 +0000</pubDate><author>matt@copperwaite.net (Matt Copperwaite)</author><guid>https://matt.copperwaite.net/blog/reminiscing-over-the-owasp-top-10/</guid><description>&lt;!--alex disable failure-->
&lt;!--alex disable failures-->
&lt;p>I was having a discussion with some freinds recently where we found that we were in agreement about how &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221008005542/https://owasp.org/Top10/">much less useful the OWASP Top 10 list is since the updates&lt;/a>. I found that no one had written anything that was critical of the 2021 changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before the 2021 change I would use the OWASP Top 10 as a checklist for when engineers wanted to know how to improve the security of their web services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Understandably the delivery of web services has changed significantly since the last time the Top 10 was run in 2017. But those changes don&amp;rsquo;t apply to everyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s good that OWASP are looking to include more of the delivery pipeline. But this means when I direct an engineer to it they&amp;rsquo;re provided confusing wording and subjects that could be outside of their responsibility, making engineers looking to cover the basics no-longer able to find the information they need.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are the changes I find interesting:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures: This one used to be about data leaks. This is now somehow, about cryptographic failure, crypto, sounds like, if not about Bitcoin, then about encryption. Would gaining access to a public file in S3 that contains sensitive data count as a cryptographic failure?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A04:2021-Insecure Design: This one talks about &amp;ldquo;move left&amp;rdquo; with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scare_quotes">scare quotes&lt;/a> like it&amp;rsquo;s a fad. Insecure Design sounds to me like an upfront task, before any engineer has a look-in.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration: Security Misconfiguration is pretty much the entire list isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A09:2021-Security Logging and Monitoring Failures: Is it a failure? Or does it not exist?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Also &lt;em>A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components&lt;/em> and &lt;em>A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failures&lt;/em> are too closely related.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The changes and the reasoning for them is not well explained on the Top 10 page itself. If I was looking for advice on how to to secure pipeline I would not automatically think of OWASP. Instead I think I will still use the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210820092716/https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">2017 reference for in most situations&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sophisticated Attack</title><link>https://matt.copperwaite.net/blog/sophisticated-attack/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Sep 2022 18:18:32 +0100</pubDate><author>matt@copperwaite.net (Matt Copperwaite)</author><guid>https://matt.copperwaite.net/blog/sophisticated-attack/</guid><description>&lt;!--alex disable attack-->
&lt;!--alex disable attacks-->
&lt;p>A trend I and some friends in the industry noticed over the last few years is that whenever a company gets hacked they almost always &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Abbc.co.uk%2Fnews%20%22sophisticated%20attack%22">call it a &amp;ldquo;sophisticated attack&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>. It kind of became a running joke, no-matter whether the attack was a Denial of Service, or data left in a public S3 bucket, that term was always used.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The latest one to use that term is the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-63056838">Chief Executive of Optus&lt;/a>, a mobile service provider in Australia, when they had their data stolen, seemingly by having their data available publicly on the web. This time &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ClareONeilMP/status/1574361824102711296">the government of Australia called them out on this&lt;/a>. Serious questions should be asked whether a government should call out a private business in that way, and the impact on their working relationship in the future, but it is refreshing for that term being picked up as being false by the media.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s strange is that whenever these hacks occur they always use the same &amp;lsquo;sophisticated attack&amp;rsquo; term. Almost as if there is a single comms playbook being used across all these organisations and countries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reason the term is used is because companies want the public to think that the hack wasn&amp;rsquo;t a trivial amount of effort and deflecting criticism that the company were negligent in their responsibilities in finding and patching vulnerabilities. Whereas the reality is that these events are inevitable and we need to plan for and minimise them. Does a mobile service provider need to store people&amp;rsquo;s driving license details?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway, I wanted to explore why this term &amp;lsquo;sophisticated attack&amp;rsquo; is being so widely used. Where did it originate? How old is it? Is there a playbook? And lastly, can we improve how it is used?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first step is to check Google Trends:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://trends.google.co.uk/trends/explore?date=all&amp;amp;q=%22sophisticated%20attack%22&amp;amp;hl=en-GB">&lt;img src="https://matt.copperwaite.net/img/blog-post/sophisticated-attack/google-trends.png" alt="A chart of Google Trends">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well that was disappointing. I was expecting a linear or exponential increase. If anything it&amp;rsquo;s a decrease. The related queries seem to involve military usage, so perhaps the term originates in the military and that has been transferred to cyber security. It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the first time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During this research I discovered that &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-06-06-dnp-sophisticated-hack-attack-dont-believe-the-hype.html">I&amp;rsquo;m not alone&lt;/a> in trying to look in to the origins. I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with some of the language used, but if a paid journalist can&amp;rsquo;t find the origins I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can either.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ok, so let&amp;rsquo;s finish off by looking at how we can use the term &amp;lsquo;sophisticated attack&amp;rsquo; better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets start by identifying what it is not. Some of the types of attack people in the industry tend to exclude are open services leaking data and DDoS. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to base the definition off a list of types of weaknesses because having an exhaustive list will be difficult to maintain. The other commonality is that these exploits can be performed by anyone pressing a button, such as on a DDoS service or an online scanning tool like Nessus. It seems to me then that the definition can exclude running a single script or action to perform the exploit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That means that chaining exploits is probably a better way to define the level of sophistication. If the attack involved 2 or more steps to get access to the data that seems like it took effort and skill. If an attacker found a &lt;a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Server_Side_Request_Forgery">SSRF&lt;/a> to exfiltrate cookies and used that to gain access to a poorly protected admin interface, that is 2 or 3 steps. By these metrics that is sophisticated. Perhaps for you it may mean 4 steps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This measure also means as security improves 2 steps can be the norm and 3 steps will be the new sophisticated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By communicating about these attacks better we can start to have real conversations about how to protect data better.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Experiments in Stateless Terraform</title><link>https://matt.copperwaite.net/blog/experiments-in-stateless-terraform/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 May 2022 18:10:32 +0100</pubDate><author>matt@copperwaite.net (Matt Copperwaite)</author><guid>https://matt.copperwaite.net/blog/experiments-in-stateless-terraform/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.bejarano.io/terraform-stateless/">This article about the history of statefulness in Terraform&lt;/a> really resonated with me. Over the last few months I have been playing with setting up Terraform in such a way that the state file was no-longer required.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post is about sharing my observations from those experiments because what I found instead was that with the current way AWS works, while it is possible to use Terraform without state, there are some limitations with AWS that made this more difficult than you would expect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The key issue you encounter when you no-longer know the state of your infrastructure is identifying which resources are no-longer needed. You either need to enumerate them, or to discard them without being aware that they exist. The first solution I tried was to use the AWS Account as an ephemeral container for everything that is built and destroyed. This guarantees to find everything and is reasonably quick to achieve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do recognise that what I&amp;rsquo;m attempting to do is a hack, Terraform and AWS are not designed to be used this way. Terraform has not made their decision to use state in isolation, they will have encountered the problems I further on in this article and the solution they went for was adding complexity through state. I don&amp;rsquo;t see that as unreasonable, they made those decisions based upon the limitations of AWS at the time, and AWS made their own decisions based on assumptions about how their infrastructure was intended to be used.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="becoming-stateless">Becoming stateless&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The concept is that everything you need is first built in to one AWS Account and when you want to release a new instance, re-create everything in a second AWS Account and fail over to it. The first AWS Account can then be removed. A separate AWS Account with a load balancer can then perform the switching when the new infrastructure is up and running. This is a form of &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-blue-green-deployment">Green/Blue Deployment&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="member_account_payment_instrument_required">MEMBER_ACCOUNT_PAYMENT_INSTRUMENT_REQUIRED&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are a some limitations with this, and this is where I think it gets interesting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My first thought to clearing out the old resources is to delete the AWS Account. However, the deletion of AWS Accounts from an AWS Organization requires the sub-account to have credit card details associated to the Account. That makes it a manual step. A manual step means no automated Green/Blue deployment.&lt;/p>
&lt;!--alex ignore black hole-->
&lt;p>There is an alternative. I call it the &amp;ldquo;black hole&amp;rdquo;. This is an OU in your AWS Organization that has a policy on it that prevents all roles from being assumed in that Account. That way your resources cannot run and your cost will reach zero.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This then runs in to another issue. There are soft limits on the number of sub-Accounts that an AWS Organization can have. By default 10. When you&amp;rsquo;re doing continuous deployments, you do the math on the number of Accounts you will need per day. It &lt;em>is&lt;/em> a &lt;em>soft&lt;/em> limit, so you can ask Amazon nicely for it to be increased, but I bet in a short amount of time you will have an unhappy Amazon asking you what you are up to and can you please stop.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="better-solutions">Better Solutions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The only other way of doing this is to follow the enumeration path. Fortunately tooling such as &lt;a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke">cloud-nuke&lt;/a> exist to empty an AWS Account of resources. You can even be selective about allow-listing certain resources, but it is a very slow process and it &lt;a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/issues/281">may not cover everything&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the interesting part here was finding the limits of what was possible in AWS. Not something I encounter often. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of experience in other PaaS services so I would love to hear if doing this is possible in Azure or GCP.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do wonder if its something Amazon will fix, but I also think it is a fundamental limitation in how AWS assumed Accounts would be used. Otherwise they would have no doubt made it easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A different, but unattainable solution I&amp;rsquo;ve started to see with services like &lt;a href="https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/working-with-services#editing-and-activating-versions-of-services">Fastly&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://docs.doppler.com/docs/versioning">Doppler&lt;/a> is that they have configuration versioning built right in to their web UI.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am hopeful that this is a tend towards a &lt;a href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/clickops/">ClickOps model&lt;/a> which has the ability to make Infrastructure as Code, and therefore managing state, redundant. The first PaaS services to do infrastructure versioning this way is going to get a lot of attention to me. However, I don&amp;rsquo;t see this happening in AWS for a long time.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
